# Manifesto Alignment Review - All Templates

**Date:** August 30, 2025
**Version:** 01
**Reviewer:** Guardian of The Learning Machine Manifesto

---

**Overall Alignment Score:** 8.2/10

**One-Sentence Verdict:** A remarkably strong collection of templates that successfully embodies the Learning Machine mindset, with some templates achieving perfect manifesto alignment while others need cultural reinforcement to prevent enterprise thinking creep.

---

## **Strengths: Principles Embodied**

* **Principle:** üéØ **Assume Nothing, Test Everything**
  * **Evidence:** From experiment-brief.md: *"We don't build features; we test assumptions. Every line of code is a hypothesis waiting to be validated or invalidated."* And from problem-validation-sprint.md: *"Problem: [Specific observable behavior that suggests pain]"* with measurable validation criteria.
  * **Analysis:** The templates consistently force hypothesis-driven thinking rather than assumption-based planning, perfectly embodying this core principle.

* **Principle:** üíÄ **Celebrate Funerals for Bad Ideas**
  * **Evidence:** From failure-celebration.md: *"An invalidated hypothesis that saves six months of engineering is a massive victory"* and the complete "Funeral Notice" section including "Date of Death," "Cause of Death," and "Value of Death."
  * **Analysis:** This goes beyond just accepting failure‚Äîit actively celebrates learning from invalidated hypotheses as cultural victories, exactly as the manifesto prescribes.

* **Principle:** üìä **Data Over Drama**
  * **Evidence:** From test-plan.md: *"H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis): [State the assumption we're trying to disprove]"* and consistent separation of "Objective Findings" from "Interpretation" across multiple templates.
  * **Analysis:** Templates force intellectual honesty by starting with null hypotheses and separating observation from interpretation, preventing confirmation bias.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Areas for Improvement: Mindset Deviations**

* **Principle at Risk:** üß† **Mindset is the OS**
  * **Evidence:** The release-runbook.md states: *"Following it is not about compliance, it's about professional excellence"* but contains no philosophy section or cultural reinforcement.
  * **Deviation Analysis:** This reads like enterprise operations documentation rather than startup experimentation. It treats deployment as execution rather than a learning opportunity, missing the manifesto's emphasis that "templates don't build products; people do."
  * **Suggested Improvement:** Add a philosophy section: *"Our Deployment Philosophy: Every release is an experiment. We deploy to learn, not just to execute. Each deployment tests our assumptions about user needs, system reliability, and market readiness."*

* **Principle at Risk:** üîÑ **The Loop is Our Lifeline**
  * **Evidence:** Multiple templates end without explicit "What's the next hypothesis?" sections. The test-plan.md focuses heavily on statistical methodology but doesn't emphasize how results spawn new experiments.
  * **Deviation Analysis:** While templates have good structure, they don't consistently reinforce that every experiment should generate new hypotheses, breaking the Build-Measure-Learn loop continuity.
  * **Suggested Improvement:** Add a mandatory final section to all experiment templates: *"Next Hypothesis Generated: Based on these results, our next riskiest assumption to test is..."*

* **Principle at Risk:** üöÄ **Seek Velocity, Not Perfection**
  * **Evidence:** The test-plan.md includes detailed statistical methodology but lacks emphasis on learning speed. Line 45: *"Statistical Power Analysis"* suggests enterprise-grade rigor over startup velocity.
  * **Deviation Analysis:** While statistical rigor is valuable, the emphasis on methodological perfection could slow learning velocity‚Äîexactly what the manifesto warns against.
  * **Suggested Improvement:** Add velocity reminders: *"Speed Check: If this test design takes >1 week to execute or requires >90% statistical confidence, consider a simpler learning approach first."*

## üö® **Potential Traps & Blind Spots**

* **Trap Identified:** üé≠ **Weaponized Principles**
  * **Analysis:** The craftsmanship-debt-tracker.md provides debt scoring but could be weaponized as a "Seek Velocity" excuse. Line 148: *"Debt is a tool, not a lifestyle"* is too vague and could justify poor craft as "experimentation."
  * **Fortification Action:** Add explicit bad faith detection: *"Red Flag Warning: If 'experimentation' becomes your excuse for avoiding architectural thinking or if debt scores never trigger hardening sprints, you're weaponizing velocity. Schedule mandatory Red Team review."*

* **Trap Identified:** ‚ö° **The Pressure Test**
  * **Analysis:** Only the crisis-decision-framework.md explicitly addresses decision-making under pressure. Other templates lack safeguards for when teams might abandon principles during crunch time.
  * **Fortification Action:** Add pressure-test reminders to experiment templates: *"Under Pressure Protocol: When deadline pressure mounts, return to the 3 AM Test questions. Pressure is when we need these principles most, not least."*

---

## üïí **The 3 AM Test Check**

1. **Riskiest Assumption:** Yes for experiment-brief.md and problem-validation-sprint.md, but No for test-plan.md and release-runbook.md - they don't clearly identify the core assumption being tested.

2. **How to Test:** Yes for most templates with strong methodology sections, but release-runbook.md treats deployment as execution rather than testing.

3. **Kill Result:** Yes for templates with clear GO/NO-GO criteria, but some use vague language like "if engagement is low" rather than specific thresholds.

4. **Learning from Failure:** Yes for failure-celebration.md and experiment-brief.md, but test-plan.md still has success-oriented language rather than celebrating learning from invalidation.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è **Final Recommendation**

**Approve with priority revisions.** The template collection demonstrates exceptional manifesto alignment in the core experimental thinking templates (Crisis Decision Framework, Failure Celebration, Experiment Brief). However, immediate attention needed for Release Runbook transformation and cultural reinforcement additions to prevent enterprise thinking creep. The strongest templates prove that deep manifesto integration creates powerful startup tools - we need to bring the weaker templates to this same standard.

---

## üéØ **Template-by-Template Analysis**

### **1. Crisis Decision Framework - Score: 10/10**

**üü¢ Perfect Manifesto Embodiment:**

* **Protects against Pressure Test failure mode**: Lines 10-15 explicitly state *"Tough times are when we need these principles most, not least"*
* **3 AM Test integration**: Lines 41-47 force clear answers to core questions before ANY decision
* **Pre-commitment defense**: Lines 14-15 *"We're writing this while calm so we can execute it while stressed"*
* **Anti-weaponization**: Lines 62-68 ban emotional language like "We're fucked" and "This changes everything"

### **2. Failure Celebration Template - Score: 10/10**

**üü¢ Exceptional Manifesto Implementation:**

* **Pure "Celebrate Funerals"**: Lines 12-13 *"An invalidated hypothesis that saves six months of engineering is a massive victory"*
* **Anti-Blame Game protection**: Lines 127-130 explicitly call out bad faith behaviors
* **Cultural programming**: Lines 14-15 explain how *"Public failure is cultural programming"*
* **Leadership accountability**: Lines 168-173 require leaders to participate and go first

### **3. Experiment Brief (Technical Docs) - Score: 9/10**

**üü¢ Exceptional Strengths:**

* **Perfect 3 AM Test alignment**: Line 26 explicitly asks for "riskiest assumption"
* **Celebrates Funerals**: Lines 140-151 include a complete "Funeral Notice" section
* **Data Over Drama**: Lines 121-124 separate "Objective Findings" from "Interpretation"
* **Velocity focus**: Line 58 includes "Debt Score" (1-5) forcing conscious speed/quality trade-offs
**‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Enhancement Needed:**
* **Red Team trigger missing**: Should explicitly state when Red Team review is required

### **4. Red Team Review - Score: 9/10**

**üü¢ Strong Manifesto Alignment:**

* **Perfect weaponization prevention**: Lines 150-157 table distinguishing "Bad Faith" vs "Good Faith" criticism
* **Data Over Drama enforcement**: Lines 54-65 force methodology audits and bias detection
* **Intellectual dissent structure**: Lines 14-15 make dissent "a shared responsibility, not an act of individual courage"
**‚ö†Ô∏è Enhancement Opportunity:**
* **Missing 3 AM Test integration**: Should include section asking "Can you instantly answer why this experiment matters?"

### **5. Craftsmanship Debt Tracker - Score: 8/10**

**üü¢ Good Safeguards:**

* **Velocity Trap protection**: Lines 10-14 explicitly prevent "Learning Loophole"
* **Conscious trade-offs**: Lines 27-67 rubric forces honest debt assessment
* **Cultural defense**: Lines 135-142 identify red flags when debt becomes dysfunction
**‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement:**
* **Lacks celebration of learning**: Focuses on debt management but doesn't celebrate what we learned by taking debt
* **Missing connection to business value**: Should explicitly connect debt scores to customer impact/business risk

### **6. Problem Validation Sprint - Score: 8/10**

**üü¢ Strong Hypothesis Thinking:**

* **Clear testable assumptions**: Lines 17-21 force specific, measurable problem hypotheses
* **Pre-committed kill criteria**: Lines 34-50 define exact GO/NO-GO thresholds
* **Emotional pain focus**: Lines 36, 103-104 seek emotional reactions, not just rational problems
**‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Elements:**
* **No explicit null hypothesis**: Should state "There is no significant emotional pain around this problem"
* **Weak 3 AM Test connection**: Doesn't clearly identify "riskiest assumption"

### **7. Design Phase Experiment Brief - Score: 7/10**

**üü¢ Good Structure:**

* **Hypothesis framework**: Lines 41-48 use proper If/Then/Because structure
* **Kill criteria**: Lines 54-60 define specific stop conditions
* **Debt awareness**: Lines 105-110 include craftsmanship debt scoring
**‚ö†Ô∏è Significant Gaps:**
* **Missing philosophy section**: No cultural mindset embedding like other templates
* **Weak failure celebration**: Lines 93-99 mention learning from failure but don't celebrate it
* **No Red Team integration**: Should reference when Red Team review is needed

### **8. Test Plan - Score: 6/10**

**üü¢ Strong Data Discipline:**

* **Null hypothesis focus**: Lines 28-30 properly state H‚ÇÄ as default assumption
* **Pre-committed decisions**: Lines 115-131 define exact actions based on results
* **Anti-p-hacking**: Lines 83-89 require pre-defined analysis segments
**‚ö†Ô∏è Major Improvements Needed:**
* **Violates "Celebrate Funerals"**: Despite good methodology, overall tone is success-focused
* **Missing cultural elements**: No philosophy section or mindset reinforcement
* **Weak velocity focus**: Should emphasize learning speed over statistical perfection

### **9. Release Runbook - Score: 5/10**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Significant Manifesto Misalignment:**
**üü¢ Limited Strengths:**

* **Clear guardrails**: Lines 6-16 establish safety-first culture
* **Rollback celebration**: Line 13 states *"A rollback is not a failure. It is a successful execution of our safety protocol"*
**üö® Major Issues:**
* **Zero experimental thinking**: Treats deployment as execution, not learning opportunity
* **Missing hypothesis framework**: No mention of what assumptions this release tests
* **No learning capture**: Doesn't ask "What did this deployment teach us?"
* **Enterprise mindset**: Reads like corporate ops, not startup experimentation
