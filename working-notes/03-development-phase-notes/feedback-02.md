# CTO Feedback (Round 2) on Development Templates

**TO:** Product Team
**FROM:** CTO
**DATE:** 2025-08-29
**SUBJECT:** Final Mandate: Simplify and Consolidate Development Templates

## 1. Overall Assessment

We've made progress, but this is not done. The new templates (`build-plan.md`, `pre-flight-checklist.md`, `experiment-debrief.md`) are a significant step in the right direction‚Äîthey are leaner and more focused.

However, they are still too verbose, and the continued existence of the old, bureaucratic templates (`release-checklist.md`, `experiment-results-log.md`) is unacceptable. This redundancy is not a minor issue; it is a guaranteed source of confusion, wasted effort, and process drift. It tells the team that we have two ways of doing things, which is the same as having no clear process at all.

**My mandate is simple: Delete the old templates. Adopt the new ones, but make them even leaner.**

## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis

### The Redundancy Problem

- **`experiment-results-log.md` vs. `experiment-debrief.md`**: These serve the same purpose. The `debrief` is better because it focuses on the decision. The `results-log` is a bloated academic paper. **Delete `experiment-results-log.md` immediately.**
- **`release-checklist.md` vs. `pre-flight-checklist.md`**: The `pre-flight-checklist` correctly assumes automation and focuses on the critical, manual pre-launch steps. The `release-checklist` is a 100-item list of things our CI/CD pipeline should be doing for us. It encourages manual box-ticking over building a reliable, automated system. **Delete `release-checklist.md` immediately.**

### Critiques of the *New* Templates

Even the new templates have room for improvement. They've caught a bit of the "template-itis" by trying to cover every possible scenario.

1. **`build-plan.md`**: This is solid, but the `Go-Live Plan` section is too detailed for a planning document. The rollout strategy and success validation belong closer to the release itself. This plan should focus on the *what* and *why*, not the *when* and *how* of the release.

2. **`pre-flight-checklist.md`**: Good, but too long. The `Prerequisites` section is unnecessary‚Äîit's stating the obvious that our pipeline should enforce. The `Post-Launch` section is also noise; release monitoring is a dynamic activity, not a static checklist item to be filled out after the fact.

3. **`experiment-debrief.md`**: This is the best of the three. However, the `Process Learnings` and `Appendix` sections are optional nice-to-haves that can be cut. The core of this document is: What did we expect? What actually happened? What are we doing next? Everything else is secondary.

## 3. Revised & Final Templates

This is not a suggestion. This is the process now. I have removed all optional sections and clarified the purpose of each document. These are the final, approved versions. Any deviation requires my explicit approval.

I will delete the old files myself. The new, leaner versions will be the single source of truth.

### A. `build-plan.md` (Final Version)

```markdown
# Build Plan: [Feature/Experiment Name]

**Owner:** [Tech Lead] | **Status:** In Progress
**Link to PRD:** [URL] | **Link to Epic:** [URL to Jira/Linear]

## 1. Hypothesis & Goal

- **Hypothesis:** We believe that... 
- **Success Metric:** ...and we'll know we're right if [Metric] hits [Target].

## 2. Technical Plan

- **Approach:** [Brief overview of the architecture. What's new? What's changing?]
- **Key Dependencies:** [List any blocking items from other teams or services.]

## 3. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
|      |            |

```

### B. `pre-flight-checklist.md` (Final Version)

```markdown
# Pre-Flight: [Feature/Experiment Name]

**Release Owner:** [Engineer Name] | **Release Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

*This checklist is the final gate. It assumes all automated CI/CD checks have passed.*

- [ ] **Feature Flag Confirmed:** `[flag_name]` is OFF in production.
- [ ] **Analytics Confirmed:** Key metric `[metric_name]` is firing in staging.
- [ ] **Monitoring Confirmed:** Dashboards/alerts for affected services are ready. [Link]
- [ ] **Rollback Plan:** The plan is to disable the feature flag. No other steps are needed.
- [ ] **Team Notified:** Support & Product are aware the experiment is launching.

**[GO] / [NO-GO]** - Decision by [Release Owner]
```

### C. `experiment-debrief.md` (Final Version)

```markdown
# Debrief: [Feature/Experiment Name]

**Owner:** [Product Manager] | **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## 1. Hypothesis vs. Reality

- **Hypothesis:** We believed that...
- **Result:** The primary metric, `[Metric Name]`, hit `[Actual Value]` against a target of `[Target Value]`. This was a [SUCCESS/FAILURE].

## 2. Key Learning

- **What We Learned:** [The single most important insight from this experiment.]
- **What Surprised Us:** [The most unexpected outcome, qualitative or quantitative.]

## 3. The Decision

**[ ‚úÖ PERSEVERE / üîÅ PIVOT / ‚ùå KILL ]**

**Next Step:** [The immediate, single next action. e.g., "Roll out to 100%," or "Design new experiment to test X," or "Remove feature flag from codebase."]
