# Change logs

## Version 1

Generated Templates:

1. sprint-plan.md - A lightweight plan for the build cycle that defines sprint scope, goals, team structure, and risk
assessment with clear links to other documents.
2. technical-task-breakdown.md - Detailed breakdown of engineering tasks organized by backend, frontend, DevOps, and QA
with acceptance criteria, estimates, and dependency tracking.
3. release-checklist.md - Comprehensive checklist ensuring safe deployment with sections for code quality, monitoring
setup, gradual rollout, and rollback procedures.
4. experiment-results-log.md - Structured document for tracking experiment performance, collecting data, analyzing
results, and making evidence-based decisions about the feature's future.

Each template follows the lean philosophy with:
- ✅ One-sentence purpose statements
- ✅ Actionable prompts and checklists
- ✅ Interconnected references between documents
- ✅ Developer-focused examples in italics
- ✅ Clear markdown structure for easy scanning

## Version 2

⏺ ✅ Validation Complete - Templates Improved

The CTO feedback has been validated and implemented. Here's what was accomplished:

📋 Analysis of CTO Feedback

✅ VALID - The criticism was spot-on:
- Original templates were too bureaucratic for a startup environment
- Static markdown files for dynamic tracking is anti-pattern
- Over-documentation slows velocity instead of accelerating learning
- Approval bottlenecks diffuse ownership and create delays

🚀 New Lean Templates Created

1. build-plan.md (replaces sprint-plan + technical-task-breakdown)
- Focused on Why/How/Gotchas - No ceremony, just essential alignment
- Links to issue tracker - Acknowledges that task tracking belongs in proper tools
- Risk-focused - Emphasizes assumptions and mitigation strategies
- One-page format - Can be quickly read and updated

2. pre-flight-checklist.md (replaces release-checklist)
- Assumes CI/CD automation - Only covers non-automatable checks
- Safety-focused - Feature flags, monitoring, rollback procedures
- Communication-focused - Team coordination without approval bottlenecks
- Action-oriented - Clear go/no-go decision making

3. experiment-debrief.md (replaces experiment-results-log)
- Learning-focused - What we learned vs. what we documented
- Decision-oriented - Clear persevere/pivot/kill outcomes
- Process improvement - How to run better experiments next time
- Concise format - Essential insights, not academic reports

📝 Original Templates Updated

- Added deprecation notices with clear guidance
- Preserved original content for teams that prefer comprehensive documentation
- Directed users to lean alternatives

🎯 Key Improvements Aligned with CTO Feedback:

- ✅ Velocity over ceremony - Templates focus on shipping and learning
- ✅ Tools for tracking - Dynamic project management in proper systems
- ✅ Automation over manual - CI/CD handles routine validations
- ✅ Ownership over approvals - Teams make decisions, not committees
- ✅ Learning over reporting - Focus on insights and next actions
