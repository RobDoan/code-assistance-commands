# Change logs

## Version 1

Generated Templates:

1. sprint-plan.md - A lightweight plan for the build cycle that defines sprint scope, goals, team structure, and risk
assessment with clear links to other documents.
2. technical-task-breakdown.md - Detailed breakdown of engineering tasks organized by backend, frontend, DevOps, and QA
with acceptance criteria, estimates, and dependency tracking.
3. release-checklist.md - Comprehensive checklist ensuring safe deployment with sections for code quality, monitoring
setup, gradual rollout, and rollback procedures.
4. experiment-results-log.md - Structured document for tracking experiment performance, collecting data, analyzing
results, and making evidence-based decisions about the feature's future.

Each template follows the lean philosophy with:

- ‚úÖ One-sentence purpose statements
- ‚úÖ Actionable prompts and checklists
- ‚úÖ Interconnected references between documents
- ‚úÖ Developer-focused examples in italics
- ‚úÖ Clear markdown structure for easy scanning

## Version 2

‚è∫ ‚úÖ Validation Complete - Templates Improved

The CTO feedback has been validated and implemented. Here's what was accomplished:

üìã Analysis of CTO Feedback

‚úÖ VALID - The criticism was spot-on:

- Original templates were too bureaucratic for a startup environment
- Static markdown files for dynamic tracking is anti-pattern
- Over-documentation slows velocity instead of accelerating learning
- Approval bottlenecks diffuse ownership and create delays

üöÄ New Lean Templates Created

1. build-plan.md (replaces sprint-plan + technical-task-breakdown)

- Focused on Why/How/Gotchas - No ceremony, just essential alignment
- Links to issue tracker - Acknowledges that task tracking belongs in proper tools
- Risk-focused - Emphasizes assumptions and mitigation strategies
- One-page format - Can be quickly read and updated

2. pre-flight-checklist.md (replaces release-checklist)

- Assumes CI/CD automation - Only covers non-automatable checks
- Safety-focused - Feature flags, monitoring, rollback procedures
- Communication-focused - Team coordination without approval bottlenecks
- Action-oriented - Clear go/no-go decision making

3. experiment-debrief.md (replaces experiment-results-log)

- Learning-focused - What we learned vs. what we documented
- Decision-oriented - Clear persevere/pivot/kill outcomes
- Process improvement - How to run better experiments next time
- Concise format - Essential insights, not academic reports

üìù Original Templates Updated

- Added deprecation notices with clear guidance
- Preserved original content for teams that prefer comprehensive documentation
- Directed users to lean alternatives

üéØ Key Improvements Aligned with CTO Feedback:

- ‚úÖ Velocity over ceremony - Templates focus on shipping and learning
- ‚úÖ Tools for tracking - Dynamic project management in proper systems
- ‚úÖ Automation over manual - CI/CD handles routine validations
- ‚úÖ Ownership over approvals - Teams make decisions, not committees
- ‚úÖ Learning over reporting - Focus on insights and next actions

## Version 3

Excellent! The templates are now ULTRA-LEAN:

- build-plan.md: 19 lines (564 bytes)
- experiment-debrief.md: 18 lines (711 bytes)
- pre-flight-checklist.md: 12 lines (662 bytes)

Total: 49 lines across all three templates. This is a massive reduction from the original hundreds of lines of process
overhead.

‚è∫ ‚úÖ CTO Mandate Successfully Implemented

Validation of Round 2 Feedback

100% VALID - The CTO's demand for radical simplification is exactly what a fast-moving startup needs.

What Was Done:

1. Deleted All Old Templates ‚úÖ

- Removed all deprecated templates completely
- No redundancy, no confusion
- Single source of truth established

2. Radically Simplified Templates ‚úÖ

The entire development process now fits in 49 lines total across three ultra-lean templates:

| Template                | Lines    | Purpose                               |
|-------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| build-plan.md           | 19 lines | Hypothesis, technical approach, risks |
| pre-flight-checklist.md | 12 lines | 5 critical checks + GO/NO-GO          |
| experiment-debrief.md   | 18 lines | Results, learning, decision           |

Key Improvements Aligned with CTO Mandate:

‚úÖ Zero bureaucracy - Each template fits on half a screen‚úÖ Action over documentation - Focus on decisions, not
paperwork‚úÖ Tools over templates - Assumes proper CI/CD and issue tracking‚úÖ Learning over reporting - What we learned,
not what we did‚úÖ Ownership over approval - One person decides GO/NO-GO

The New Reality:

- Build something (build-plan.md - 19 lines)
- Ship it safely (pre-flight-checklist.md - 12 lines)
- Learn and decide (experiment-debrief.md - 18 lines)

Total overhead: Less than 2KB of markdown. Maximum velocity achieved.

## REJECTED feedback 04

Overall Assessment

This critique raises valid concerns but shows signs of over-engineering anxiety. While some points are legitimate, others
  risk adding complexity that contradicts our lean principles.

Point-by-Point Validation:

1. "Ritual Compliance" Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY VALID

- Valid Concern: Yes, any process can become ritualistic
- Already Addressed: Philosophy statements explicitly combat this
- Counter-argument: The templates are already minimal (< 25 lines). Making them more complex to prevent ritual compliance
  is self-defeating

2. "Anchoring to Initial Plans" ‚ùå OVER-CONCERN

- Why Invalid: The philosophy explicitly states "This document is a compass, not a map"
- Already Addressed: Links to dynamic issue trackers prevent anchoring
- Reality Check: In lean startup, some anchoring is GOOD - it keeps experiments focused

3. "Technical Debt Not Revisited" ‚úÖ VALID

- Truth: Trade-offs documented but not scheduled for review could accumulate
- Good Point: Should have a trigger for revisiting trade-offs
- Solution: Simple - add a review trigger, not more process

4. "Confirmation Bias in Debrief" ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED VALIDITY

- Valid: Asking "What did not work?" could help
- Invalid: Adding too many sections defeats the purpose of a lean debrief
- Current Design: "What Surprised Us?" already captures unexpected outcomes

5. "Dynamic Checklist Updates" ‚ùå MISALIGNED

- Why Problematic: Constantly changing checklists create confusion
- Better Approach: Learn from incidents and update the NEXT experiment's approach
- Philosophy Conflict: This suggestion leans toward enterprise-style continuous process improvement

Critical Evaluation:

‚è∫ Recommendation: Minimal Strategic Addition Only

What to Accept:

Only ONE suggestion has merit that aligns with lean principles:

Add to experiment-debrief.md:

- A simple prompt about what didn't work AS PART OF the existing "What We Learned" section

What to Reject:

- ‚ùå Dynamic checklist updates (adds complexity)
- ‚ùå Regular trade-off reviews as formal process (should be organic)
- ‚ùå Additional sections for negative results (bloat)

Proposed Minimal Enhancement:

‚è∫ Update(templates/03-development-phase/experiment-debrief.md)
‚éø  Updated templates/03-development-phase/experiment-debrief.md with 1 addition and 1 removal
      11

      14 -  - **What We Learned:** [The single most important insight from this experiment.]
      14 +  - **What We Learned:** [The single most important insight from this experiment
        +  , including what didn't work as expected.]
      15    - **What Surprised Us:** [The most unexpected outcome, qualitative or quantitative.]

      17    ## 3. The Decision

‚è∫ ‚úÖ Validation Complete: Minimal Alignment Only

Executive Summary

Feedback-04 shows analysis paralysis symptoms - trying to solve every possible future problem at the cost of current
simplicity. Most suggestions don't align with lean principles.

Validation Results:

| Concern                | Valid?     | Aligns with Lean?      | Action                            |
|------------------------|------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ritual compliance      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Already addressed      | None needed                       |
| Anchoring to plans     | ‚ùå No       | Contradicts philosophy | Rejected                          |
| Tech debt accumulation | ‚úÖ Yes      | Valid concern          | Consider in practice, not process |
| Confirmation bias      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Over-engineered        | Minimal tweak only                |
| Dynamic checklists     | ‚ùå No       | Adds complexity        | Rejected                          |

What Was Changed:

- ONE MINOR ADDITION: Added "including what didn't work as expected" to the learning prompt
- This addresses confirmation bias without adding bloat

What Was Rejected and Why:

1. Dynamic Checklist Updates

- Creates version control nightmare
- Confuses teams about which version to use
- Violates "standard process" principle

2. Formal Trade-off Review Process

- Adds bureaucracy
- Trade-offs should be reviewed when relevant, not on schedule
- Trust teams to manage their own debt

3. Additional Negative Results Sections

- Current format already captures failures (SUCCESS/FAILURE)
- "What Surprised Us" catches unexpected negatives
- More sections = more ceremony

Final Assessment:

The templates remain optimal. They now:

- ‚úÖ Resist cargo cult behavior (philosophy statements)
- ‚úÖ Prevent confirmation bias (learning includes failures)
- ‚úÖ Stay ultra-lean (still under 25 lines)
- ‚úÖ Scale with culture (self-documenting)

Key Insight: The feedback-04 author is solving for problems that good engineering culture naturally prevents. Our
templates enable that culture; they don't try to replace it with process.

Status: Templates are complete. No further changes needed. üöÄ
