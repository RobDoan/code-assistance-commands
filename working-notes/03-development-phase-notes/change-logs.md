# Change logs

## Version 1

Generated Templates:

1. sprint-plan.md - A lightweight plan for the build cycle that defines sprint scope, goals, team structure, and risk
assessment with clear links to other documents.
2. technical-task-breakdown.md - Detailed breakdown of engineering tasks organized by backend, frontend, DevOps, and QA
with acceptance criteria, estimates, and dependency tracking.
3. release-checklist.md - Comprehensive checklist ensuring safe deployment with sections for code quality, monitoring
setup, gradual rollout, and rollback procedures.
4. experiment-results-log.md - Structured document for tracking experiment performance, collecting data, analyzing
results, and making evidence-based decisions about the feature's future.

Each template follows the lean philosophy with:

- ‚úÖ One-sentence purpose statements
- ‚úÖ Actionable prompts and checklists
- ‚úÖ Interconnected references between documents
- ‚úÖ Developer-focused examples in italics
- ‚úÖ Clear markdown structure for easy scanning

## Version 2

‚è∫ ‚úÖ Validation Complete - Templates Improved

The CTO feedback has been validated and implemented. Here's what was accomplished:

üìã Analysis of CTO Feedback

‚úÖ VALID - The criticism was spot-on:

- Original templates were too bureaucratic for a startup environment
- Static markdown files for dynamic tracking is anti-pattern
- Over-documentation slows velocity instead of accelerating learning
- Approval bottlenecks diffuse ownership and create delays

üöÄ New Lean Templates Created

1. build-plan.md (replaces sprint-plan + technical-task-breakdown)

- Focused on Why/How/Gotchas - No ceremony, just essential alignment
- Links to issue tracker - Acknowledges that task tracking belongs in proper tools
- Risk-focused - Emphasizes assumptions and mitigation strategies
- One-page format - Can be quickly read and updated

2. pre-flight-checklist.md (replaces release-checklist)

- Assumes CI/CD automation - Only covers non-automatable checks
- Safety-focused - Feature flags, monitoring, rollback procedures
- Communication-focused - Team coordination without approval bottlenecks
- Action-oriented - Clear go/no-go decision making

3. experiment-debrief.md (replaces experiment-results-log)

- Learning-focused - What we learned vs. what we documented
- Decision-oriented - Clear persevere/pivot/kill outcomes
- Process improvement - How to run better experiments next time
- Concise format - Essential insights, not academic reports

üìù Original Templates Updated

- Added deprecation notices with clear guidance
- Preserved original content for teams that prefer comprehensive documentation
- Directed users to lean alternatives

üéØ Key Improvements Aligned with CTO Feedback:

- ‚úÖ Velocity over ceremony - Templates focus on shipping and learning
- ‚úÖ Tools for tracking - Dynamic project management in proper systems
- ‚úÖ Automation over manual - CI/CD handles routine validations
- ‚úÖ Ownership over approvals - Teams make decisions, not committees
- ‚úÖ Learning over reporting - Focus on insights and next actions

## Version 3

Excellent! The templates are now ULTRA-LEAN:

- build-plan.md: 19 lines (564 bytes)
- experiment-debrief.md: 18 lines (711 bytes)
- pre-flight-checklist.md: 12 lines (662 bytes)

Total: 49 lines across all three templates. This is a massive reduction from the original hundreds of lines of process
overhead.

‚è∫ ‚úÖ CTO Mandate Successfully Implemented

Validation of Round 2 Feedback

100% VALID - The CTO's demand for radical simplification is exactly what a fast-moving startup needs.

What Was Done:

1. Deleted All Old Templates ‚úÖ

- Removed all deprecated templates completely
- No redundancy, no confusion
- Single source of truth established

2. Radically Simplified Templates ‚úÖ

The entire development process now fits in 49 lines total across three ultra-lean templates:

| Template                | Lines    | Purpose                               |
|-------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| build-plan.md           | 19 lines | Hypothesis, technical approach, risks |
| pre-flight-checklist.md | 12 lines | 5 critical checks + GO/NO-GO          |
| experiment-debrief.md   | 18 lines | Results, learning, decision           |

Key Improvements Aligned with CTO Mandate:

‚úÖ Zero bureaucracy - Each template fits on half a screen‚úÖ Action over documentation - Focus on decisions, not
paperwork‚úÖ Tools over templates - Assumes proper CI/CD and issue tracking‚úÖ Learning over reporting - What we learned,
not what we did‚úÖ Ownership over approval - One person decides GO/NO-GO

The New Reality:

- Build something (build-plan.md - 19 lines)
- Ship it safely (pre-flight-checklist.md - 12 lines)
- Learn and decide (experiment-debrief.md - 18 lines)

Total overhead: Less than 2KB of markdown. Maximum velocity achieved.
