# CTO Feedback on Development Phase Templates

**TO:** Product Team
**FROM:** CTO
**DATE:** 2025-08-29
**SUBJECT:** Feedback on T-shirt Sizing for Development Templates

## 1. Overall Assessment

These templates are well-intentioned but will crush our velocity under the weight of their own bureaucracy. They favor process over progress and documentation over shipping. In their current state, they will hinder, not help, a fast-moving team.

We are a startup, not an enterprise. Our goal is to maximize the rate of learning. That means shipping, measuring, and iterating as fast as possible. This documentation suite, as proposed, does the opposite. It introduces ceremony, encourages status-tracking in static files (a cardinal sin), and creates approval bottlenecks that diffuse ownership.

We need to gut them and focus on the absolute minimum required to build, measure, and learn.

## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis

### `sprint-plan.md`

* **What to Keep:** `Experiment Context`, `Sprint Goals` (especially `Out of Scope`), and `Risk Assessment`. These are high-level alignment tools and are valuable.
* **What to Cut:** The `Sprint Backlog` table is 100% waste. It duplicates the `technical-task-breakdown.md` and will be instantly out of date. Project management does not belong in a Markdown file. The `Definition of Done` should be a team-level agreement, understood by all, not copied into a template for every sprint.
* **Verdict:** This document should be a 1-pager that answers "Why are we doing this?" and "What does success look like?". Nothing more.

### `technical-task-breakdown.md`

* **What to Keep:** The *act* of breaking down features into technical tasks is essential. The `Acceptance Criteria` are the most valuable part of this document.
* **What to Cut:** Everything else. The tables for `Estimate`, `Assigned`, and `Status` belong in our issue tracker (e.g., Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues), which is dynamic and designed for this purpose. The `Progress Tracking` and `Sprint Burndown` sections are pure administrative overhead that a proper tool automates. The Mermaid diagram is a nice thought that will never be maintained after day one.
* **Verdict:** This document is trying to be a project management tool, and it fails at it. The output of the breakdown exercise should be tickets in our issue tracker, not this file.

### `release-checklist.md`

* **What to Keep:** The concept of a checklist is good for preventing stupid mistakes. The focus on `Monitoring`, `Feature Flags`, and `Rollback Procedures` is smart.
* **What to Cut:** At least 60% of this. Items like `Code Review Completed` and `Tests Passing` should be enforced by an automated CI/CD pipeline, not a manual checkbox. If you can manually check it, you can automate it. The `Sign-off` section is a classic bottleneck; the team owns the release, not a list of managers. The `Gradual Rollout` plan is too prescriptive for a template.
* **Verdict:** This should be a lean "Pre-Flight Checklist" that covers only the critical, non-automatable, release-specific steps and communication points.

### `experiment-results-log.md`

* **What to Keep:** This is the most valuable template of the bunch because it forces us to look at the data. `Hypothesis`, `Success Criteria`, `What We Learned`, and the `Go/No-Go Decision` are the heart of it.
* **What to Cut:** The ceremony. The `Business Impact Assessment` is pure speculation. The weekly tracking is too rigid. The `Sign-off` is, again, a bottleneck. The goal is to make a decision, not write an academic paper.
* **Verdict:** Keep the core, but make it a lean "Experiment Debrief". Focus on the data, the learnings, and the decision.

## 3. Revised & Improved Templates

Here are my proposed replacements. They are leaner, focused on action, and assume we use our tools (like Jira and CI/CD) correctly.

### A. `build-plan.md` (Replaces `sprint-plan.md` and `technical-task-breakdown.md`)

```markdown
# Build Plan: [Feature/Experiment Name]

**Status:** In Progress | Done | Shipped
**Owner:** [Tech Lead]
**Link to PRD:** [Link]

## 1. The "Why"

### Hypothesis
*What specific assumption are we validating with this build?*

### Core Goal(s)
*What one or two things must be true for this to be a success?*
-
-

### Out of Scope
*What we are explicitly NOT doing.*
-
-

## 2. The "How"

### Technical Approach
*A brief overview of the plan. What new services, components, or database changes are needed? What's the high-level architecture?*

### Key Tasks & Issue Tracker
*The detailed breakdown of tasks lives in the issue tracker, not here.*
- **Link to Epic/Initiative:** [Link to Jira/Linear/GitHub Epic]

## 3. The "Gotchas"

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
|      |            |

### Key Dependencies
- [e.g., Final design assets from Figma]
- [e.g., API key from third-party service]
```

### B. `pre-flight-checklist.md` (Replaces `release-checklist.md`)

```markdown
# Pre-Flight Checklist: [Feature/Experiment Name]

**Release Owner:** [Engineer Name]
**Release Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

*This checklist assumes all automated checks (CI/CD, unit/integration tests) have passed.*

## 1. Safety & Measurement
- [ ] **Feature Flag Confirmed:** The feature is behind `[flag_name]` and is OFF by default.
- [ ] **Analytics Confirmed:** Key metrics (`[metric_1]`, `[metric_2]`) are firing correctly in staging.
- [ ] **Monitoring Confirmed:** Dashboards and alerts for new/affected services are ready.
- [ ] **Rollback Plan Ready:** The plan is to disable the feature flag. Is any other action needed (e.g., data cleanup)?

## 2. Communication
- [ ] **Team Notified:** The engineering team is aware of the release window.
- [ ] **Support Notified:** The support team has been briefed on what users might see and who to contact.
- [ ] **Stakeholders Notified:** Product/Biz team knows the experiment is going live.

## GO / NO-GO
- [ ] **Final Decision:** GO
- **By:** [Release Owner]
```

### C. `experiment-debrief.md` (Replaces `experiment-results-log.md`)

```markdown
# Experiment Debrief: [Feature/Experiment Name]

**Owner:** [Product Manager]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Experiment Duration:** [X days]

## 1. Hypothesis & Goal

**Hypothesis:** *We believed that...*
**Success Metric:** *We knew we were right if [Metric] changed to [Target].*

## 2. The Results

### The Numbers
| Metric | Target | Actual | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|        |        |        | ‚úÖ/‚ùå |

### Qualitative Insights
*What did users say? What did we observe? (Bulleted list)*
-
-

## 3. Learnings & Decision

### What We Learned
*What surprised us? What assumption was wrong? (Bulleted list)*
-
-

### Final Decision
**[ ‚úÖ PERSEVERE / üîÅ PIVOT / ‚ùå KILL ]**

**Rationale:**
*A brief, one-sentence explanation.*

**Next Steps:**
*Based on the decision, what is the immediate next action?*
-
```
