- "Why This Thesis Could Be Wrong" section forces intellectual honesty

2. hypothesis-list.md â†’ The Hypothesis Engine

- Idea Triage section for low-friction idea capture
- Red flags vs Green lights framework prevents bias
- Quick Decision Framework (RICE filter) for prioritization
- Pipeline Health metrics track learning velocity (30-40% success rate target)

3. problem-validation-sprint.md â†’ Emotional Pain Focus

- Problem hypothesis includes emotional impact ("causes them to feel")
- Enhanced interview script probes for emotional reactions and urgency
- "Hair on Fire" scale quantifies problem urgency
- Evidence Locker separates facts from opinions

4. opportunity-landscape.md â†’ Strategy Sprint

- Strategic implications section connects learnings to big picture
- Learning durability framework for when to re-examine findings

ðŸ”— System Integration Features:

- Clear verdict formats (Validated/Invalidated/Inconclusive)
- Immediate action checklists with owners and timelines
- Cost tracking creates accountability for learning investments

Learning Flywheel:

- Explicit cross-references between all templates
- Housekeeping checklists ensure document synchronization
- Version tracking shows strategic evolution over time
- Pipeline health metrics optimize learning velocity
