# Change logs

## Version 1 - Created

Templates Created:

1. release-plan.md - Strategic deployment planning with rollout approach, success criteria, and rollback triggers
2. release-checklist.md - Systematic verification checklist ensuring no critical steps are missed
3. deployment-guide.md - Step-by-step technical instructions for executing the deployment
4. monitoring-plan.md - Comprehensive observability strategy with dashboards, alerts, and escalation procedures
5. post-release-monitoring-log.md - Real-time monitoring log for capturing observations and decisions

Key Features:

Safety & Learning Philosophy - Each template starts with a clear purpose statement emphasizing safe releases and rapid learning

Interconnected Design - Templates reference each other and link back to development phase outputs

Actionable Checklists - Clear go/no-go decision points with specific thresholds and timeframes

Emergency-Ready - Clean, scannable structure designed for use under pressure during incidents

Progressive Rollout Support - Canary, blue-green, and gradual deployment strategies with monitoring checkpoints

## Version 2 - after feedback 01

‚è∫ Improved Templates Created

Replaced 5 complex documents with 2 actionable ones:

1. release-runbook.md

- Single source of truth for each deployment
- Copy-paste commands with placeholders for specific values
- Specific numeric thresholds for rollback decisions
- Direct dashboard links and monitoring queries
- Progressive rollout timeline with clear go/no-go checkpoints
- Emergency procedures readily accessible

2. post-release-log.md

- Simple chronological format for real observations
- Example entries showing realistic deployment scenarios
- Practical insights captured for team learning
- Quick reference section with common patterns

Key Improvements

Actionability: Every command is copy-pasteable, every threshold is numeric, every link is direct

Consolidation: One runbook replaces five separate documents that scattered critical information

Pressure-tested: Designed for 2 AM emergency deployments, not planning meetings

Learning-focused: Post-release log captures actual insights for continuous improvement

The feedback was spot-on - these templates prioritize getting deployments done safely rather than creating documentation overhead.
