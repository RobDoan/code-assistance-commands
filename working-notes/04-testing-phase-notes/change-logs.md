# Change logs

## Generate version 1

1. test-plan.md - The strategic document that defines hypotheses, success metrics, and experimental design with
statistical rigor
2. test-case.md - Detailed validation scenarios ensuring technical correctness and data accuracy before launch
3. bug-tracker.md - Systematic issue logging with priority matrices and impact assessment on test validity
4. user-feedback-log.md - Qualitative data capture with thematic analysis to understand the "why" behind metrics
5. learning-summary.md - The synthesis document that answers hypotheses definitively and extracts actionable insights

Each template includes:
- Scientific purpose statements
- Data-driven prompts and metrics requirements
- Cross-document linking placeholders
- Italicized practical examples
- Clear markdown structure with tables and checklists

## Version 2 - after feedback-01

Critical Improvements Made:

test-plan.md:
- ✅ Null hypothesis section - Forces teams to state what they're trying to disprove
- ✅ Business value connection - Prevents vanity metrics by requiring causal links to business outcomes
- ✅ Pre-defined analysis segments - Eliminates p-hacking by requiring upfront segment commitments
- ✅ Stricter decision framework - Prevents moving goalposts with clear pre-committed thresholds

user-feedback-log.md:
- ✅ Three-part structure - Separates observed behavior, verbatim feedback, and observer interpretation
- ✅ Bias quarantine - Prevents contamination of raw observations with assumptions

learning-summary.md:
- ✅ Objective vs. subjective separation - Forces distinction between data facts and team beliefs
- ✅ Executive summary first - Clear decision and business impact upfront

These changes transform the templates from "data theater" into genuinely rigorous scientific instruments that defend against
confirmation bias, p-hacking, and wishful thinking while maintaining practical usability for product teams.
