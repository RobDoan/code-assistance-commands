# Change logs

## Generate version 1

1. test-plan.md - The strategic document that defines hypotheses, success metrics, and experimental design with
statistical rigor
2. test-case.md - Detailed validation scenarios ensuring technical correctness and data accuracy before launch
3. bug-tracker.md - Systematic issue logging with priority matrices and impact assessment on test validity
4. user-feedback-log.md - Qualitative data capture with thematic analysis to understand the "why" behind metrics
5. learning-summary.md - The synthesis document that answers hypotheses definitively and extracts actionable insights

Each template includes:

- Scientific purpose statements
- Data-driven prompts and metrics requirements
- Cross-document linking placeholders
- Italicized practical examples
- Clear markdown structure with tables and checklists

## Version 2 - after feedback-01

Critical Improvements Made:

test-plan.md:

- ✅ Null hypothesis section - Forces teams to state what they're trying to disprove
- ✅ Business value connection - Prevents vanity metrics by requiring causal links to business outcomes
- ✅ Pre-defined analysis segments - Eliminates p-hacking by requiring upfront segment commitments
- ✅ Stricter decision framework - Prevents moving goalposts with clear pre-committed thresholds

user-feedback-log.md:

- ✅ Three-part structure - Separates observed behavior, verbatim feedback, and observer interpretation
- ✅ Bias quarantine - Prevents contamination of raw observations with assumptions

learning-summary.md:

- ✅ Objective vs. subjective separation - Forces distinction between data facts and team beliefs
- ✅ Executive summary first - Clear decision and business impact upfront

These changes transform the templates from "data theater" into genuinely rigorous scientific instruments that defend against
confirmation bias, p-hacking, and wishful thinking while maintaining practical usability for product teams.

## Version 3 - after feedback-02

Refinements Applied:

✅ Eliminated Redundancy:

- Removed the duplicate "Original Hypothesis Review" section
- Merged hypothesis details into the Executive Summary

✅ Enhanced Information Flow:

- Original hypothesis now appears at the top where decisions are made
- Objective findings section strengthened with better formatting and practical significance
- Cleaner progression from executive summary → objective/subjective analysis → detailed results

✅ Improved Clarity:

- Renamed "Segment Analysis" to "Pre-Defined Segment Analysis" to reinforce the anti-p-hacking purpose
- Added practical significance explanation in subjective interpretation
- Bolded key statistics for better readability

Final Assessment:
The testing phase templates are now statistically rigorous, practically usable, and defendable against common experimental pitfalls.
They enforce:

- Null hypothesis thinking
- Business value metrics
- Pre-committed analysis segments
- Objective vs. subjective distinction
- Clean decision frameworks

The templates transform experimentation from "data theater" into genuine scientific inquiry with intellectual honesty built into the
process.

Summary of Cultural Improvements Applied

The VP's feedback revealed a critical blindspot: technical rigor without cultural safety creates perverse incentives. The improvements
address this systematically:

Key Cultural Enhancements:

1. Testing Manifesto in test-plan.md:

- Explicitly reframes testing as learning, not winning
- Creates psychological safety for "failed" experiments
- Establishes cultural norms upfront before bias sets in

2. Invalidation Celebration in learning-summary.md:

- Direct congratulatory message for invalidated hypotheses
- Reframes "failure" as successful waste prevention
- Reinforces learning value at the moment of potential disappointment

Why This Matters:

- Prevents teams from gaming the system with safe, trivial tests
- Maintains statistical rigor while fostering innovation culture
- Creates social cover for ambitious bets that might fail
- Transforms process from judgment mechanism to knowledge generation

Final Assessment:
The templates now address both the mechanical challenge (statistical rigor) and the human challenge (psychological safety). This dual
approach prevents the common failure mode where perfect processes are undermined by fearful execution.

The system now actively cultivates a culture that celebrates learning over confirmation, making it sustainable for long-term innovation
  rather than just short-term wins.
