## Feedback 01


✅ Implemented Changes:

1. Experiment Brief (was PRD)

- Shift from requirements to experiments: Focuses on the riskiest assumption and falsifiable hypothesis
- Radical simplification: Removes feature-list mindset, centers on learning goals
- Clear If/Then structure: Forces hypothesis to be testable and measurable
- Learning plan: Requires upfront planning for both success and failure scenarios

2. User Journey Map (was User Flows)

- Critical path focus: Only the shortest sequence needed to validate hypothesis
- Removes speculation: Eliminated subjective "user feelings" sections
- Risk-focused: Identifies drop-off points as learning opportunities
- Minimal screens: Just the essential UI needed for the test

3. Prototype Spec (was Wireframes)

- Job-to-be-done framing: Each screen has a clear validation purpose
- ASCII simplicity: Enforces low-fidelity thinking
- Copy over pixels: Focuses on messaging rather than design details
- No documentation bloat: Just enough visual guide for engineers

4. Tech Feasibility Check (was Architecture Outline)

- 15-minute assessment: Quick Q&A format instead of detailed planning
- Safety first: Simple checklist for feature flags and rollback
- Traffic light system: Clear Green/Yellow/Red verdict
- Prevents over-engineering: Catches experiments that are too complex

✅ Key Improvements:

- Hypothesis-driven: Every template centers on validating assumptions
- Speed-optimized: Designed for rapid experimentation, not documentation
- Interconnected: Templates reference each other and build on previous decisions
- Learning-focused: Emphasizes validated learning over feature delivery
- Safe to fail: Built-in mechanisms for quick rollback and iteration
