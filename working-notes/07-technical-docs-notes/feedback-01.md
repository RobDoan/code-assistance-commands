# Review: Lean Documentation Templates

**ROLE:** Pragmatic Principal Engineer, "Lean Documentation" Champion

---

## 1. Overall Alignment Score: 9/10

This is an exceptional set of documentation templates. It's one of the best examples I've seen of a system that is not just internally consistent, but is built with a deep, unifying philosophy. The templates successfully translate the high-level, cultural principles of "The Learning Machine Manifesto" into practical, developer-friendly tools, while adhering to the structural recommendations of the "Lean Technical Documentation Structure" guide.

The system's greatest strength is its relentless focus on **learning as the primary metric of progress**. Every template is a tool for thought, designed to facilitate a hypothesis-driven workflow. The few points deducted are for minor areas where the desire for comprehensiveness could potentially introduce friction and "documentation theater," which can be easily refined.

## 2. Template-by-Template Feedback

### `README.md`

* **Strengths:** Excellent job setting the tone and immediately linking to the Manifesto. The "Quick Navigation" and "3 AM Test" sections are brilliant for action-orientation and reinforcing the culture.
* **Gaps & Misalignments:** It's great, but it could be even more of a "guardrail" by providing a visual map of the core workflow.
* **Concrete Suggestion:** Add a simple Mermaid diagram showing the primary path: `Experiment Brief` -> `ADR` (if needed) -> `Development Workflow` -> `Release Runbook` -> `Learning Library`. This would visually reinforce the "The Loop is Our Lifeline" principle.

### `EVOLUTION_GUIDE.md`

* **Strengths:** This is a fantastic and rare document. It operationalizes the "Everything is a Draft" meta-principle from the Manifesto. The metrics and health dashboard are superb for "Data Over Drama".
* **Gaps & Misalignments:** It feels a bit heavy for a "lean" system. The "Long-Term Evolution Vision" is good, but might be too much "analysis paralysis" for a startup.
* **Concrete Suggestion:** Simplify the "Long-Term Evolution Vision" into a single "Guiding Principle": "Our documentation should become more automated and less visible over time." This makes it more of a guiding star and less of a plan to manage.

### `decisions/adr-template.md`

* **Strengths:** This is a world-class ADR template. It perfectly embodies "Data Over Drama" and "Celebrate Funerals for Bad Ideas" by including sections for `Validation Plan` and `Negative Consequences`. The `Next Hypothesis` section is a brilliant way to close the loop.
* **Gaps & Misalignments:** It's very comprehensive, which might create friction for smaller decisions. The "Implementation Plan" section could be seen as "documentation theater" if not used carefully.
* **Concrete Suggestion:** Add a "Decision Scale" at the top: `[T-Shirt Size: S, M, L]`. For 'S' decisions, suggest that only `Context`, `Decision`, and `Rationale` are required. This provides a "guardrail" for lean usage.

### `experiments/experiment-brief.md`

* **Strengths:** This is the heart of the "Learning Machine". It's a fantastic implementation of "Assume Nothing, Test Everything". The "Kill Criteria" and "Funeral Notice" are direct, powerful translations of the manifesto.
* **Gaps & Misalignments:** The "Build Plan" is good, but could be stronger by explicitly linking to the `development-workflow.md`.
* **Concrete Suggestion:** In the `Build Plan` section, add a direct link: `Refer to the [Development Workflow](../practices/development-workflow.md) for our standard process.` This reinforces the interconnectedness.

### `learning/learning-library.md`

* **Strengths:** This is the cultural centerpiece. It makes "Celebrate Funerals for Bad Ideas" a tangible reality. The "Funeral Hall of Fame" is a brilliant piece of cultural engineering.
* **Gaps & Misalignments:** It's excellent. The only minor gap is that it could be more explicit about how to *use* this library to inform future decisions.
* **Concrete Suggestion:** Add a section at the top: "How to Use This Library". Include a bullet point: "Before starting a new `experiment-brief.md`, search this library for related invalidated assumptions. Link to them in your brief."

### `learning/risk-register.md`

* **Strengths:** This makes risk visible and manageable, which is a mature practice for a startup. It aligns with "Data Over Drama" by quantifying risks. The "Technical Debt Inventory" is a great way to make trade-offs explicit.
* **Gaps & Misalignments:** The process section (`Weekly Risk Review`, `Monthly Deep Dive`) might be too much ceremony for a fast-moving team. This can feel like "handcuffs".
* **Concrete Suggestion:** Reframe the process section to be event-triggered rather than time-triggered. For example: "Review risks when: a new major experiment is proposed, a production incident occurs, or a team member raises a new concern."

### `practices/development-workflow.md`

* **Strengths:** This is a great, practical guide. The PR template is excellent and reinforces the learning mindset. The "Debt Score" is a fantastic way to make trade-offs visible.
* **Gaps & Misalignments:** It's very good, but the "Testing" section in the PR template could be more robustly linked to the `testing-manifesto.md`.
* **Concrete Suggestion:** In the PR description template, under `## Testing`, add a link: `Ensure your tests align with our [Testing Manifesto](testing-manifesto.md).`

### `practices/testing-manifesto.md`

* **Strengths:** This is a superb, modern testing manifesto. It correctly frames testing as a tool for velocity and learning, not just correctness. The pyramid and anti-patterns are very clear.
* **Gaps & Misalignments:** It's very comprehensive. The "Team Testing Skills" table might become "documentation theater" if not updated religiously.
* **Concrete Suggestion:** Replace the "Team Testing Skills" table with a simpler "Learning Goals" section: "This quarter, we are focusing on improving our skills in [e.g., E2E testing with Cypress]. Here are some resources..." This is more action-oriented.

### `runbooks/release-runbook.md`

* **Strengths:** This is a perfect example of "Guardrails, Not Handcuffs". The copy-pasteable scripts are fantastic. The emergency quick reference is brilliant.
* **Gaps & Misalignments:** It's excellent. The only tiny gap is that it could more explicitly link the *decision* to release back to the experiment that prompted it.
* **Concrete Suggestion:** At the very top of the "Standard Release Process", add a field: `Experiment Brief driving this release: [Link to experiment-brief.md]`. This closes the loop.

### `systems/tech-stack.md`

* **Strengths:** This is a strategic document, not just a list. Linking each technology to an ADR is a fantastic implementation of the framework. The "Technology Experiments" section is a great way to manage change.
* **Gaps & Misalignments:** The "Team Velocity Metrics" are good, but could be more directly tied to the learning goals of the manifesto.
* **Concrete Suggestion:** Add a "Learning Velocity" metric to the `Team Velocity Metrics` table. For example: "Time to validate/invalidate a tech experiment: [X] days". This aligns it more closely with the core manifesto principle of learning speed.

## 3. "Quick-Start" Guide for New Engineers

* **Start with a question, not a task.** Before you write any code, grab an `experiments/experiment-brief.md`. State your riskiest assumption and define what failure looks like. This is the entry point to our entire workflow.
* **Document decisions, not just code.** If your experiment requires a significant technical choice, use the `decisions/adr-template.md`. The goal is to explain the "why" so that "future you" understands the trade-offs.
* **Celebrate learning, especially from failure.** If your experiment is invalidated, it's a win. Document it in the `learning/learning-library.md`. This is one of the most valuable contributions you can make.
