  - During retrospectives
  - For onboarding
**Impact:** Makes the library actionable rather than just archival

### 6. learning/risk-register.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Made process event-triggered rather than time-triggered
**Change Made:**
- Replaced rigid weekly/monthly/quarterly schedule with event-triggered approach
- Added specific triggers: production incidents, new experiments, team concerns, dependency changes
- Kept periodic health checks as optional backstops
**Impact:** Reduces ceremony, makes risk review more natural and less burdensome

### 7. practices/development-workflow.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Strengthened link to testing manifesto
**Change Made:**

## Overall Improvements Summary

### Alignment with Manifesto Principles
 **Better Loop Closure:** Visual workflow diagram and explicit cross-template links
 **Reduced Ceremony:** Event-triggered processes replace rigid schedules
 **Learning Focus:** Added learning velocity metrics and quarterly learning goals
 **Lean Implementation:** Decision scaling prevents over-documentation
 **Action Orientation:** Usage instructions make templates immediately actionable

### Key Themes
1. **Interconnection:** Every template now explicitly links to related templates in the workflow
2. **Simplification:** Removed complexity that could lead to "documentation theater"
3. **Event-Driven:** Replaced time-based ceremonies with trigger-based actions
4. **Learning-Centric:** Added explicit learning metrics and goals throughout

### Next Evolution Suggestions
