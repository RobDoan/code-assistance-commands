## Template-by-Template Improvements

### 1. README.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Added visual workflow diagram
**Change Made:** 
- Added Mermaid diagram showing the primary path: `Experiment Brief � ADR (if needed) � Development Workflow � Release Runbook � Learning Library`
- This visually reinforces "The Loop is Our Lifeline" principle
**Impact:** Makes the core workflow immediately visible and actionable

### 2. EVOLUTION_GUIDE.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Simplified long-term vision to avoid "analysis paralysis"
**Change Made:**
- Replaced detailed 6/12/24-month horizons with single guiding principle: "Our documentation should become more automated and less visible over time"
- Removed potentially overwhelming future planning details
**Impact:** More focused on principle rather than rigid planning, truly lean

### 3. decisions/adr-template.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Added decision scale for lean usage
**Change Made:**
- Added "Decision Scale: [S/M/L]" field at the top
- Added guidance that S (small) decisions only need Context, Decision, and Rationale sections
- Prevents "documentation theater" for minor decisions
**Impact:** Right-sized documentation based on decision magnitude

### 4. experiments/experiment-brief.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Strengthened link to development workflow
**Change Made:**
- Added explicit link in Build Plan section: "Process: Refer to the Development Workflow for our standard build process"
**Impact:** Better interconnection between templates, reinforces systematic approach

### 5. learning/learning-library.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Added explicit usage instructions
**Change Made:**
- Added new "How to Use This Library" section with four specific use cases:
  - Before starting experiments (search for related failures)
  - Linking from experiment briefs
  - During retrospectives
  - For onboarding
**Impact:** Makes the library actionable rather than just archival

### 6. learning/risk-register.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Made process event-triggered rather than time-triggered
**Change Made:**
- Replaced rigid weekly/monthly/quarterly schedule with event-triggered approach
- Added specific triggers: production incidents, new experiments, team concerns, dependency changes
- Kept periodic health checks as optional backstops
**Impact:** Reduces ceremony, makes risk review more natural and less burdensome

### 7. practices/development-workflow.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Strengthened link to testing manifesto
**Change Made:**
- Added checkbox item in PR template: "Tests align with our Testing Manifesto"
- Direct link ensures testing philosophy is reinforced at PR time
**Impact:** Better integration of testing philosophy into daily workflow

### 8. practices/testing-manifesto.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Replaced static skills table with dynamic learning goals
**Change Made:**
- Removed "Team Testing Skills" table that could become stale
- Added "Testing Learning Goals" section focused on quarterly improvement focus
- More action-oriented with specific champion, resources, and checkpoint
**Impact:** Prevents "documentation theater", focuses on active learning

### 9. runbooks/release-runbook.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Added explicit link to driving experiment
**Change Made:**
- Added field at top of Standard Release Process: "Experiment Brief driving this release: [Link]"
**Impact:** Closes the loop between experimentation and deployment

### 10. systems/tech-stack.md
**Feedback Addressed:** Added learning velocity metric
**Change Made:**
- Added row to Team Velocity Metrics: "Time to validate/invalidate tech hypothesis"
- Directly ties technology choices to learning speed principle
**Impact:** Aligns tech stack management with core manifesto principle of learning velocity

## Overall Improvements Summary

### Alignment with Manifesto Principles
 **Better Loop Closure:** Visual workflow diagram and explicit cross-template links
 **Reduced Ceremony:** Event-triggered processes replace rigid schedules
 **Learning Focus:** Added learning velocity metrics and quarterly learning goals
 **Lean Implementation:** Decision scaling prevents over-documentation
 **Action Orientation:** Usage instructions make templates immediately actionable

### Key Themes
1. **Interconnection:** Every template now explicitly links to related templates in the workflow
2. **Simplification:** Removed complexity that could lead to "documentation theater"
3. **Event-Driven:** Replaced time-based ceremonies with trigger-based actions
4. **Learning-Centric:** Added explicit learning metrics and goals throughout

### Next Evolution Suggestions
- Monitor usage patterns to identify which links are most followed
- Track time-to-complete for scaled ADRs (S/M/L) to validate the approach
- Measure if event-triggered risk reviews happen more frequently than scheduled ones
- Assess if quarterly testing goals lead to measurable skill improvements

## Round 2: Automation & Self-Awareness Improvements

### Date: 2025-08-30
### Feedback Source: Next-Level Suggestions for Living Documentation
### Theme: From Templates to Self-Aware Learning Engine

---

## Automation Tools Added

### 1. Funeral Automation (`support-tools/funeral-automation/`)
**Purpose:** Automate capture of invalidated experiments
**Template Updates:**
- `experiment-brief.md`: Added automation note in Funeral Notice section
- Automatically parses killed experiments and updates Learning Library
**Impact:** Reduces friction of documenting learnings to near zero

### 2. Risk-Incident Sync (`support-tools/risk-incident-sync/`)
**Purpose:** Create closed-loop between predictions and incidents
**Template Updates:**
- `risk-register.md`: Added automation note for incident sync
- `release-runbook.md`: Added note that rollbacks trigger risk updates
**Impact:** Validates risk predictions against reality automatically

### 3. ADR Review Reminder (`support-tools/adr-review-reminder/`)
**Purpose:** Make ADRs accountable with automated reminders
**Template Updates:**
- `adr-template.md`: Added automation note for review reminders
- Sends notifications when review dates approach
**Impact:** Ensures decisions are validated against actual outcomes

### 4. Mission Control Dashboard (`support-tools/dashboard-generator/`)
**Purpose:** Transform static README into live dashboard
**Template Updates:**
- `README.md`: Added link to generated dashboard view
- Provides real-time visibility of experiments, risks, and learnings
**Impact:** Makes documentation ambient and immediately visible

---

## Key Improvements Summary

### From Manual to Automated
- **Before:** Manual updates to Learning Library when experiments fail
- **After:** Automatic capture and PR creation for failed experiments

### From Static to Dynamic
- **Before:** Static README as entry point
- **After:** Live dashboard showing current system state

### From Passive to Active
- **Before:** ADR reviews depend on human memory
- **After:** Bot-driven reminders with specific metrics to check

### From Open-Loop to Closed-Loop
- **Before:** Risk predictions exist separately from incidents
- **After:** Incidents automatically validate or create risk entries

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Implement `funeral-automation` script
2. Test with existing killed experiments
3. Verify Learning Library updates correctly

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 3-4)
1. Deploy `risk-incident-sync` with rollback hooks
2. Connect `adr-review-reminder` to team calendars
3. Integrate with existing notification channels

### Phase 3: Visualization (Week 5-6)
1. Generate first Mission Control dashboard
2. Set up automatic refresh on commits
3. Deploy to team-accessible location

### Phase 4: Optimization (Ongoing)
1. Measure automation effectiveness
2. Tune notification frequencies
3. Add predictive analytics capabilities
