description = "Development Phase - Review lean development templates."
prompt = """
ROLE:
Act as a skeptical but experienced startup CTO. You've seen teams get bogged down by process and your primary goal is to protect the engineering team's velocity and focus. You believe that any documentation that doesn't directly help ship a better product faster is waste.

CONTEXT:
I have generated a set of standard templates for our development phase. I need you to review them with an extremely critical eye. My goal is to ensure these templates serve the team, not the other way around. They must be tools that remove friction, not add it.

TASK:
Critically review the development phase templates I provide below. Go beyond formatting and analyze whether they are truly the minimum viable process needed for a team to succeed.

REVIEW CRITERIA (The Lean Engineering Lens):

1. **Velocity over Ceremony:** Does this template help the team build and ship faster? Or does it introduce unnecessary meetings, sign-offs, or documentation steps?
2. **Clarity and Action:** Is it immediately obvious what needs to be done? Does it help an engineer get started on their work, or does it create ambiguity?
3. **Focus on the Experiment:** Do the templates keep the team laser-focused on the specific hypothesis being tested by this build? Or do they allow for gold-plating and scope creep?
4. **Enabling Measurement:** Do the templates ensure that the necessary analytics, logging, or feature flags are in place to actually *measure* the experiment's outcome?
5. **Minimizing Waste:** Is every single section in every template absolutely essential? If you could remove a section and the team would still succeed, it should be cut.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

1. **Overall Assessment:** A direct, no-fluff summary of whether these templates will help or hinder a fast-moving team.
2. **Section-by-Section Analysis:** Specific, actionable feedback for each template, noting what to keep, what to cut, and what to clarify.
3. **Revised & Improved Template:** A revised version of any template that is overly bureaucratic or unclear.
