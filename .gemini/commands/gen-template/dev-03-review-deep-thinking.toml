description = "Development Phase - Deep analysis of lean development templates."
prompt = """
ROLE:
Act as a master Systems Thinker and a veteran engineering leader who has scaled multiple startups. You understand that development processes are not just about managing tasks; they are about shaping culture, managing risk, and creating a system for sustainable innovation.

CONTEXT:
I have a set of templates for our development phase. I need to understand their second-order effects. How will these documents influence our engineering culture, our attitude towards technical debt, and our ability to pivot quickly? Are these the foundations for a high-performing team or the beginnings of a slow-moving bureaucracy?

TASK:
Perform a deep-thinking critique of the development phase templates I provide below. Analyze how this process, as a system, will impact team psychology, technical quality, and the company's long-term ability to learn and adapt.

DEEP THINKING FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY):
Step 1: First Principles Analysis

* What is the fundamental **"Job to be Done"** of a development process in a startup? *(Example: "To translate a hypothesis into working code with the minimum possible effort to maximize the rate of learning.")*
* Does this set of templates serve as an accelerator or a brake on that core job?

Step 2: Multi-Persona Stress Test
Critique the templates from the viewpoint of these key personas:

* **Persona A (The "Get it Done" Engineer):** This person wants to code, not fill out documents. Does this process feel like a helpful checklist that prevents mistakes, or a series of bureaucratic hurdles that slow them down?
* **Persona B (The "Quality-Minded" Architect):** This person is concerned about technical debt and long-term maintainability. Does this process encourage a "hack it together" mentality that will create future problems, or does it provide a framework for making conscious, short-term trade-offs?
* **Persona C (The "Anxious" Product Manager):** This person needs to know if the experiment will be ready on time and if the resulting data will be trustworthy. Does this process provide them with the right level of visibility and confidence?

Step 3: Second-Order & Cognitive Bias Analysis

* **Cultural Impact:** What kind of engineering culture do these templates promote? A culture of ownership and rapid learning, or a culture of blame and "ticket-pushing"? How do they affect the team's willingness to delete code and pivot?
* **Cognitive Bias:** Does the `sprint-plan.md` create an **"Anchoring Bias"** around initial estimates, making it hard to adapt when new information is discovered? Does the `experiment-results-log.md` have safeguards against **"Confirmation Bias"** when interpreting the data?

OUTPUT FORMAT:

1. **Strategic Assessment:** Summarize the long-term cultural and technical risks embedded in this process. What is the most likely way this system could fail or produce unintended negative consequences?
2. **Deep-Dive Analysis:** For each template, provide tactical feedback alongside a **"Systemic Insight"** that connects it to your stress test and bias analysis.
3. **Strategically Revised Template:** Provide a revised version of any template, adding a **"Our Engineering Philosophy"** section at the top that coaches the team on the mindset needed to use these tools effectively.
