## Priority Definitions

**Critical:** Blocks test execution or corrupts data

- *Example: Analytics events not firing, preventing measurement of primary metric*

**Major:** Significantly impacts user experience or secondary metrics

- *Example: Feature works but with notable performance degradation*

**Minor:** Cosmetic or edge case issues with minimal impact

- *Example: Alignment issue on specific browser that doesn't affect functionality*

**Low:** Nice-to-have improvements

- *Example: Non-standard behavior that doesn't affect test validity*

## Escalation Matrix

| Priority | Response Time | Escalation Path | Decision Authority |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Critical | < 2 hours | Engineering Lead → VP Eng | Test Owner |
| Major | < 24 hours | Test Owner → PM Lead | Test Owner |
| Minor | < 72 hours | Assigned Developer | Dev Lead |
| Low | Next Sprint | Team Planning | PM |

## Bug Patterns Analysis

### Common Issues by Category

| Category | Count | Common Root Cause |
