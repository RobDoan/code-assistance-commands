# Test Plan

**Purpose:** Define the hypothesis, success metrics, and experimental design to enable objective decision-making through controlled testing.

## Test Overview

**Test Name:** [Feature/Experiment Name]  
**Test ID:** [YYYY-MM-DD-XXX]  
**Related Documents:** 
- Product Requirements: `../design/prd.md`
- Hypothesis Source: `../research/hypothesis-list.md`
- Previous Tests: [Link to related experiments]

## Hypothesis Statement

**We believe that:** [specific user segment]  
**Will:** [expected behavior change]  
**Because:** [underlying assumption about user needs]  
**Resulting in:** [measurable business outcome]

*Example: We believe that new users will complete onboarding 25% faster because simplified navigation reduces cognitive load, resulting in a 15% increase in Day-1 retention.*

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metric
- **Metric:** [Specific KPI]
- **Current Baseline:** [Current performance]
- **Target:** [Minimum detectable effect]
- **Statistical Significance:** [Confidence level, typically 95%]

*Example: Success is a 15% or greater click-through rate on the 'new feature' button for the test group, with 95% statistical confidence.*

### Secondary Metrics
| Metric | Baseline | Expected Change | Why Track |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| [Metric 1] | [Value] | [+/- X%] | [Reason] |
| [Metric 2] | [Value] | [+/- X%] | [Reason] |

### Guardrail Metrics
- **[Critical metric that must not degrade]:** Maximum acceptable decrease: [X%]

## Experimental Design

**Test Type:** [A/B Test / Multivariate / Sequential / etc.]  
**Sample Size Required:** [Number based on power analysis]  
**Test Duration:** [Start Date] to [End Date] ([X days/weeks])  
**Traffic Allocation:** [X% to control, Y% to variant(s)]

### Audience Segmentation
- **Include:** [Specific user criteria]
- **Exclude:** [Users to exclude and why]
- **Geographic Scope:** [Regions/countries]
- **Platform:** [Web/Mobile/Both]

### Variants
1. **Control:** [Current experience description]
2. **Variant A:** [Change description]
3. **Variant B (if applicable):** [Change description]

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [L/M/H] | [L/M/H] | [Action] |
| [Risk 2] | [L/M/H] | [L/M/H] | [Action] |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Analytics tracking verified
- [ ] Sample size calculator confirmed
- [ ] Randomization logic tested
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Test cases documented in `test-case.md`
- [ ] Bug tracking system ready (`bug-tracker.md`)
- [ ] User feedback collection prepared (`user-feedback-log.md`)

## Decision Framework

**If primary metric improves by â‰¥[X%] with statistical significance:**
- Action: Roll out to 100%

**If primary metric shows no significant change:**
- Action: Analyze secondary metrics and user feedback for insights

**If primary metric degrades or guardrails are violated:**
- Action: Immediate rollback and root cause analysis
