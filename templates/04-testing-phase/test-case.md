# Test Cases

**Purpose:** Document specific scenarios to validate that the experiment functions correctly and data collection is accurate before launch.

## Test Information

**Related Test Plan:** `test-plan.md`  
**Test Environment:** [Staging/Production/Both]  
**Test Data Requirements:** [Specific test accounts/data needed]  
**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Pre-Test Validation

### Analytics Verification

| Event | Expected Trigger | Properties to Capture | Verified |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|
| [Event Name] | [User action] | [Data fields] | [ ] |
| [Event Name] | [User action] | [Data fields] | [ ] |

*Example: Event: "feature_button_clicked", Trigger: "User clicks new feature CTA", Properties: {user_id, timestamp, variant, page_source}*

### Assignment Logic

- [ ] Users correctly assigned to control/variant based on randomization
- [ ] Assignment persists across sessions
- [ ] Excluded segments properly filtered
- [ ] Traffic split matches intended allocation (Â±1%)

## Functional Test Cases

### Test Case 1: [Happy Path Scenario]

**Objective:** Verify primary user flow works as intended  
**Preconditions:** [Setup required]  
**Test Steps:**

1. [Step 1 with expected result]
2. [Step 2 with expected result]
3. [Step 3 with expected result]

**Expected Outcome:** [Final state]  
**Actual Result:** [To be filled during testing]  
**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Test Case 2: [Edge Case Scenario]

**Objective:** Test boundary conditions  
**Preconditions:** [Setup required]  
**Test Steps:**

1. [Step 1 with expected result]
2. [Step 2 with expected result]

**Expected Outcome:** [Final state]  
**Actual Result:** [To be filled during testing]  
**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Test Case 3: [Error Handling]

**Objective:** Verify graceful degradation  
**Preconditions:** [Setup required]  
**Test Steps:**

1. [Step 1 - introduce error condition]
2. [Step 2 - verify handling]

**Expected Outcome:** [Error message/fallback behavior]  
**Actual Result:** [To be filled during testing]  
**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

## Performance Testing

### Load Time Metrics

| Page/Feature | Control (ms) | Variant (ms) | Acceptable Delta |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| [Page 1] | [Baseline] | [Measured] | <100ms |
| [Feature Load] | [Baseline] | [Measured] | <50ms |

### Resource Usage

- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] API call volume within limits
- [ ] Database query performance acceptable

## Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Keyboard navigation functional
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verified
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] Alternative text present for images

## Data Quality Checks

### Event Firing Accuracy

- [ ] No duplicate events
- [ ] All required properties populated
- [ ] Timestamps accurate
- [ ] User IDs consistent

### Sample Ratio Mismatch Check

- [ ] Actual split within 1% of intended
- [ ] No systematic bias in assignment

## Rollback Testing

**Rollback Procedure:**

1. [Step to disable experiment]
2. [Step to verify control experience restored]
3. [Step to confirm data pipeline stopped]

**Verification:**

- [ ] All users see control experience
- [ ] No residual variant code active
- [ ] Analytics properly tagged as "rolled back"
