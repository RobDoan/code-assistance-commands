**Purpose:** Synthesize all quantitative and qualitative data to answer the hypothesis definitively and extract actionable insights for future iterations.

## Test Overview

**Test Name:** [Feature/Experiment Name]  
**Test ID:** [YYYY-MM-DD-XXX]  
**Test Duration:** [Start Date] to [End Date] ([X days])  
**Total Users Exposed:** [Number]

- User Feedback: `user-feedback-log.md`
- Original Hypothesis: `../research/hypothesis-list.md`

## Executive Summary & Decision

**Original Hypothesis:** [State the original H₁ from the test plan]

**Hypothesis Status:** ✅ VALIDATED / ❌ INVALIDATED / ⚠️ INCONCLUSIVE  
**Recommendation:** [SHIP / ITERATE / ABANDON]  
**Business Impact:** [Brief summary of the key result and its financial or strategic implication]

> **If your hypothesis was INVALIDATED:** Congratulations! You've just saved the company significant time and resources by learning what doesn't work before building it fully. This is a successful experiment that prevented waste and generated valuable knowledge about your users.

## Objective Findings vs. Subjective Interpretation

### Objective Findings (What the data says)
>
> Stick to the facts. Report quantitative results and direct qualitative observations.

- The primary metric **[Metric Name]** showed a relative change of **[+/-X.X%]** (Target: [Y%]) with a p-value of **[0.XX]**
- This result **[is/is not]** statistically significant at our 95% confidence threshold
- The confidence interval for the change is **[X% to Y%]**
- Guardrail metric [Metric Name] changed by [+/-Y.Y%], which [did/did not] breach our pre-defined limit
- [X%] of users in the variant group mentioned [Theme Name] in feedback surveys

### Subjective Interpretation (What we think it means)
>
> This is where we build our narrative and connect the dots.

- We believe the improvement in the primary metric is because [our interpretation of user behavior]
- Although the result wasn't statistically significant, the qualitative feedback suggests [our interpretation]
- The result was practically significant/insignificant because [explain why the magnitude of the change matters or doesn't matter to the business]
