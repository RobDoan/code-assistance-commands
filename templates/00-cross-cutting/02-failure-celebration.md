# Failure of the Month Award

**Purpose:** To ritualize learning and make "killing bad ideas" a celebrated achievement, not a hidden shame.  
**When:** First Monday of every month at All-Hands  
**Owner:** Rotating team member (everyone presents eventually)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes max (keep it punchy)

## Our Philosophy on Failure

> 💀 **An invalidated hypothesis that saves six months of engineering is a massive victory.** We don't celebrate being wrong; we celebrate learning fast and saving resources. The opposite of success isn't failure—it's waste.

> **Public failure is cultural programming.** When leaders share their failures openly, it gives everyone permission to experiment boldly. Psychological safety isn't a policy; it's what happens when the CEO admits they were completely wrong about something.

## Winner Selection Criteria

**The winning failure should be:**

1. **Genuinely believed** - We really thought it would work
2. **Properly tested** - We ran a real experiment, not just an opinion poll
3. **Quickly killed** - We stopped fast when data said stop
4. **Lesson-rich** - We learned something applicable beyond this case

**NOT eligible:**

- Failures from not trying (inaction)
- Failures from obviously bad ideas (no learning)
- Production incidents (different category)
- Personal mistakes (this is about hypotheses, not people)

## 🏆 This Month's Winner: [Experiment Name]

**Owner:** @[username]  
**Date Killed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Lifetime:** [How long from hypothesis to funeral]

### The Hypothesis

*What we believed would happen and why*

Example: "We believed that adding social features would increase retention by 20% because users said they wanted to see what their peers were doing."

### The Experiment

*How we tested it (quickly and cheaply)*

Example: "We created a fake 'Activity Feed' button that showed a coming soon page. Tracked clicks and email signups for interest."

### The Moment of Truth

*The specific data that killed it*

Example: "Only 2% of users clicked the button. Of those, 90% immediately bounced. User interviews revealed they come here to work alone, not socialize."

### Resources Saved

- **Engineering Time:** [X weeks/months]
- **Money:** $[Amount not spent]
- **Opportunity Cost:** [What we did instead]

**Total Value of This Failure:** $[Estimate]

### The Learning That Changes Everything

*What fundamental assumption did this invalidate? How does this change our strategy?*

Example: "We learned our users are 'single-player mode' people. This killed our entire social roadmap and redirected us toward productivity features."

## The Presentation Format (10 min)

1. **Setup (2 min):** What we believed and why it was reasonable
2. **The Test (3 min):** How we tested it quickly and cheaply
3. **The Data (2 min):** The brutal facts that killed it
4. **The Learning (2 min):** What this teaches us going forward
5. **The Celebration (1 min):** Thank people who helped kill it fast

### Presentation Rules

- No apologies allowed ("Sorry this didn't work" = banned phrase)
- No hedging ("It might have worked if..." = banned)
- Own it with pride ("We killed this fast and saved $X")
- Make it a story, not a report

## Historical Hall of Fame

*Our most valuable failures that shaped who we are:*

| Date | Failed Hypothesis | Savings | Key Learning |
|------|------------------|---------|--------------|
| 2023-01 | "Build it and they will come" | $2M | Need distribution before product |
| 2023-06 | "More features = more value" | 9 months | Simplicity beats completeness |
| 2023-11 | "Enterprises want our product" | $500K | Wrong customer, wrong product |
| 2024-03 | "AI everything" | 6 months | Users want AI for specific tasks only |

## The Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)

### Fake Failures

- Killing something that was never really tried
- Calling pivots "failures" for the award
- Manufactured failures to look learning-oriented

### Blame Disguised as Learning

- "We learned that [other team] can't execute"
- "We learned that customers are stupid"
- "We learned that the market isn't ready" (usually BS)

### Success Theater

- Only celebrating trivial failures
- Avoiding discussion of painful failures
- Leadership never winning the award

---

## The Ritual

### Pre-Meeting

- [ ] Nominations collected by last Thursday
- [ ] Winner selected by leadership + previous winner
- [ ] Presenter prepares 10-min story
- [ ] Trophy updated with new nameplate

### During All-Hands

1. Last month's winner introduces this month's award
2. 10-minute presentation of the winning failure
3. Physical trophy handover (yes, we have an actual trophy)
4. Group acknowledgment: "Thank you for saving us from [specific waste]"
5. Trophy sits on winner's desk for the month

### The Trophy

- Actual physical object (not just a Slack emoji)
- Engraved with "Killed It Fast"
- Previous winners' nameplates attached
- Travels to winner's desk/workspace

---

## Leadership Commitment

**To make this real, leadership must:**

- Present their own failures (go first)
- Never punish someone who wins this award
- Reference these learnings in strategy discussions
- Treat the trophy with actual respect

**Red flags this is becoming theater:**

- Same people never nominated
- Only small failures celebrated
- Winners face subtle negative consequences
- It becomes a joke rather than honor
