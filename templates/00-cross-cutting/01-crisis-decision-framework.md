# Crisis Decision Framework

**Purpose:** To maintain our learning mindset when pressure peaks. This is our pre-committed playbook for when shit hits the fan.  
**When to Use:** Missed targets, competitor launches, funding pressure, major incidents, deadline crisis  
**Owner:** Leadership team (activated by any member)  
**Key Principle:** We decided how to decide before emotions took over

## Our Philosophy Under Pressure

> ⚡ **Tough times are when we need these principles most, not least.** When everyone else panics and abandons process for "heroics," we double down on disciplined learning. This framework is our shield against fear-based decisions.

> **Pre-commitment is our defense against panic.** We're writing this while calm so we can execute it while stressed. Future-us will want to abandon everything for a Hail Mary. This document is current-us preventing that.

## The 3 AM Test - Crisis Edition

*Before ANY decision, answer these:*

1. **Are we solving or just reacting?**
2. **Will this decision still make sense in 30 days?**
3. **Are we protecting the core or everything?**
4. **What would we advise another company to do?**
5. **Are we abandoning principles or applying them?**

**If you can't answer these clearly, STOP. You're panicking, not thinking.**

## Crisis Decision Protocol

### Step 1: Reality Check (30 minutes)

**No storytelling. Just facts:**

- **What actually happened:** [Specific, measurable event]
- **Verified impact:** [Real numbers, not projections]
- **Time constraint:** [Actual deadline vs. artificial urgency]
- **Resources available:** [People, money, time - be realistic]

**Banned phrases during Reality Check:**

- "We're fucked"
- "This changes everything"
- "We need to pivot completely"
- "Competitors will eat us"
- "We have no choice"

### Step 2: Core vs. Context (20 minutes)

**What must survive (Core):**

- [ ] Customer trust
- [ ] Team psychological safety
- [ ] Learning velocity
- [ ] [Your specific core value]

**What can be sacrificed (Context):**

- [ ] Feature timeline
- [ ] Perfect execution
- [ ] Competitive parity
- [ ] Short-term metrics

**The Rule:** Protect the core at all costs. Everything else is negotiable.

### Step 3: Options Generation (30 minutes)

Generate exactly 3 options (force creativity):

#### Option A: Double Down

- Stick to current strategy but execute faster
- When it works: Problem is execution, not strategy
- Risk: Doing the wrong thing harder

#### Option B: Tactical Pivot

- Keep strategy, adjust tactics significantly
- When it works: Direction is right, approach is wrong
- Risk: Half-measures that please no one

#### Option C: Strategic Shift

- Fundamental change in approach
- When it works: Core assumption proven false
- Risk: Panic-driven overcorrection

**For each option, fill out:**

- Hypothesis: What must be true for this to work
- Success metric: How we'll know it's working
- Kill criteria: When we'd abandon this path
- Craftsmanship debt: What corners we're cutting

### Step 4: Pre-Mortem (20 minutes)

**Imagine it's 90 days later and we failed. Why?**

| Option | Likely Failure Mode | Probability | Mitigation |
|--------|--------------------:|------------|------------|
| A | Ran out of time | High/Med/Low | [Specific action] |
| B | Half-measure didn't move needle | High/Med/Low | [Specific action] |
| C | Overcorrected and lost identity | High/Med/Low | [Specific action] |

### Step 5: Decision & Commitment (10 minutes)

**Decision:** Option [A/B/C]

**Why this option:**

- Protects: [Which core values]
- Sacrifices: [What we're giving up]
- Hypothesis: [What we believe will happen]
- Evidence: [Why we believe it]

**Commitment Checklist:**

- [ ] All leaders aligned (not necessarily agreeing)
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Kill criteria established
- [ ] Review date set (max 2 weeks)
- [ ] Communication plan ready

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Hail Mary

- Symptom: "This one weird trick will save us"
- Reality: Magical thinking disguised as boldness
- Instead: Multiple small bets with fast learning

### The Everything Pivot

- Symptom: "Our entire strategy is wrong"
- Reality: Panic-driven overcorrection
- Instead: Change one variable at a time

### The Hero Complex

- Symptom: "I'll handle everything myself"
- Reality: Burnout disguised as leadership
- Instead: Distribute ownership, maintain sustainability

### The Ostrich

- Symptom: "This is temporary, stay the course"
- Reality: Denial disguised as strength
- Instead: Acknowledge reality, adapt intelligently
