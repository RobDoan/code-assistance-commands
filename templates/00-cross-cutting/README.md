# Cross-Cutting Tools & Safeguards

**Purpose:** These templates are cultural safeguards that apply across ALL phases of product development. They are the immune system of our Learning Machine.

## The Four Pillars of Cultural Defense

### 1. 🛡️ [Craftsmanship Debt Tracker](./craftsmanship-debt-tracker.md)
**When to Use:** Throughout development lifecycle
- **Design Phase:** Initial debt score assignment
- **Development Phase:** Active debt management
- **Testing Phase:** Hardening decisions
- **Deployment Phase:** Post-launch debt assessment

### 2. 🔴 [Red Team Review](./red-team-review.md)
**When to Use:** Before any major commitment
- Experiments affecting >1000 users
- Investments >$10K
- Strategic direction changes
- High-risk technical approaches

### 3. 💀 [Failure Celebration](./failure-celebration.md)
**When to Use:** Monthly ritual
- When killing any hypothesis
- When stopping any experiment
- When invalidating any assumption
- First Monday of every month (award ceremony)

### 4. ⚡ [Crisis Decision Framework](./crisis-decision-framework.md)
**When to Use:** When pressure peaks
- Missed quarterly targets
- Competitor launches
- Major customer churn
- Production incidents
- Team morale crisis

## Integration with Phase Templates

### Required References
These phase-specific templates MUST reference the cross-cutting tools:

- **`02-design-phase/01-experiment-brief.md`** → Links to Debt Tracker & Red Team
- **`03-development-phase/build-plan.md`** → Links to Debt Tracker
- **`04-testing-phase/test-plan.md`** → Links to Red Team for methodology review
- **`05-deployment-phase/release-runbook.md`** → Links to Crisis Framework

### Cultural Checkpoints

| Phase | Primary Tool | Secondary Tools |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Research | Red Team (for big bets) | Failure Celebration |
| Design | Red Team + Debt Tracker | Crisis (if pivoting) |
| Development | Debt Tracker | Red Team (for approach) |
| Testing | Failure Celebration | Red Team (for bias) |
| Deployment | Crisis Framework | Debt Tracker |

## The Meta-Principle

These aren't just templates—they're cultural programming. They exist to:

1. **Prevent the Learning Loophole** (Debt Tracker)
2. **Protect against bias** (Red Team)
3. **Celebrate truth-seeking** (Failure Award)
4. **Maintain principles under pressure** (Crisis Framework)

**Remember:** If you're not using at least one of these tools weekly, you're not really following the Learning Machine Manifesto.
