# Cross-Cutting Concerns: Culture as Code

> **These are the guardrails that make the safe path the easy path.**
>
> Cross-cutting concerns aren't documentation - they're our cultural immune system in action.

## Our Philosophy

These templates encode the **Learning Machine Manifesto** into our daily decisions:

- **Crisis Protocols** - How we maintain principles when pressure hits
- **Failure Celebrations** - How we extract value from invalidated assumptions  
- **Red Team Reviews** - How we challenge our own biases before the market does
- **Craftsmanship Debt** - How we make the cost of speed visible and conscious

## The 4 Cultural Safeguards

### üö® **Crisis Decision Framework**

*[crisis-decision-framework.md](crisis-decision-framework.md)*

**When to Use:** When deadlines loom and pressure mounts to abandon our principles

**The Problem It Solves:** Teams abandon their learning mindset exactly when they need it most

**3 AM Test Question:** *"What framework will guide our decisions when we're stressed and scared?"*

### üíÄ **Failure Celebration Protocol**

*[02-failure-celebration.md](02-failure-celebration.md)*

**When to Use:** When hypotheses get invalidated or experiments "fail"

**The Problem It Solves:** Teams hide failures instead of extracting their learning value

**3 AM Test Question:** *"How do we turn our most expensive mistakes into our most valuable assets?"*

### üõ°Ô∏è **Red Team Review Process**

*[red-team-review.md](red-team-review.md)*

**When to Use:** Before any major decision, experiment, or architectural choice

**The Problem It Solves:** We miss our own blind spots and biases

**3 AM Test Question:** *"Who's trying to prove us wrong before our customers do?"*

### üìä **Craftsmanship Debt Tracker**

*[03-craftsmanship-debt-tracker.md](03-craftsmanship-debt-tracker.md)*

**When to Use:** Every time we choose speed over craft in our experiments

**The Problem It Solves:** Technical debt becomes invisible until it's too expensive to fix

**3 AM Test Question:** *"What's the real cost of our need for speed?"*

## When Pressure Hits Protocol

*The ultimate test of cross-cutting concerns*

### The 3-Question Crisis Filter

Before making any decision under pressure, ask:

1. **üéØ Assumption Check:** "What assumption are we making that we haven't tested?"
2. **üöÄ Velocity Check:** "Will this help us learn faster or just feel busy?"  
3. **üíÄ Failure Check:** "What would we celebrate if this completely fails?"

### Crisis Decision Tree

```
High Pressure Decision
         ‚Üì
   Can we test it in 1 day?
    ‚Üô           ‚Üò
  YES            NO
   ‚Üì             ‚Üì
Test it      Red Team Review
   ‚Üì             ‚Üì
Learn        Challenge assumptions
   ‚Üì             ‚Üì
Decide       Test or Kill
```

## Anti-Patterns We Defend Against

### üé≠ **Weaponized Principles**

- **Bad Faith:** "We need to kill this idea" (because I'm uncomfortable)
- **Good Faith:** "This data invalidates our hypothesis" (let's pivot)
- **Safeguard:** Red Team Review separates idea from person

### ‚ö° **Pressure Abandonment**

- **The Trap:** Abandoning principles when we need them most
- **The Reality:** Tough times require more structure, not less
- **Safeguard:** Crisis Decision Framework pre-commits us to principled choices

### üèÉ **Velocity Theater**

- **Bad Faith:** "Let's ship fast" (to avoid hard work)
- **Good Faith:** "Let's test our riskiest assumption first" (to learn fast)
- **Safeguard:** Craftsmanship Debt Scores make trade-offs visible

## Usage Patterns

### For Individual Contributors

- **Before starting any work:** Check if this needs Red Team Review
- **When choosing speed over craft:** Log the Craftsmanship Debt Score
- **When something fails:** Use Failure Celebration to extract learning
- **When pressure hits:** Apply the Crisis Decision Framework

### For Team Leaders  

- **Model the behavior:** Be the first to celebrate your failures publicly
- **Enforce the safeguards:** Make Red Team Reviews mandatory for big decisions
- **Track the metrics:** Monitor debt scores and learning velocity
- **Protect the culture:** Use Crisis Framework to maintain principles under pressure

### For Product Teams

- **Hypothesis design:** Every feature starts with Red Team challenge
- **Experiment planning:** Set failure criteria using Failure Celebration template
- **Crisis management:** Use frameworks to maintain learning mindset during tough quarters
- **Retrospectives:** Track how well safeguards protected team learning

## Integration with Other Phases

### Research Phase Connection

- Red Team Reviews challenge research assumptions before experiments begin
- Failure Celebration captures learning from invalidated hypotheses

### Design Phase Connection  

- Crisis Framework guides design decisions under timeline pressure
- Craftsmanship Debt tracking informs architectural trade-offs

### Development Phase Connection

- Debt scoring makes velocity trade-offs conscious and measurable  
- Red Team Reviews challenge technical approaches before implementation

### Testing Phase Connection

- Failure Celebration reframes "failed" tests as valuable learning
- Crisis Framework maintains testing rigor under shipping pressure

### Deployment Phase Connection

- Crisis protocols guide rollback decisions and incident response
- Red Team thinking anticipates failure modes before they occur

---

## Success Metrics

### Cultural Health Indicators

- **Failure Celebration Frequency:** Teams celebrating 1+ invalidated assumptions per month
- **Red Team Engagement:** 100% of major decisions get challenged before implementation
- **Crisis Framework Usage:** Principles maintained even during pressure periods
- **Debt Consciousness:** 90% of velocity decisions include explicit debt scores

### Learning Acceleration Signs

- Teams preemptively surfacing risks before they become problems
- Open discussion of failures without blame or defensiveness  
- Faster pivot decisions when data contradicts assumptions
- Higher quality decisions during high-pressure situations

## Evolution Notes

These safeguards themselves follow the Learning Machine principles:

- **They're experiments** - We track if they actually improve our culture
- **They evolve** - Templates change based on how teams actually use them
- **They can die** - If a safeguard becomes bureaucracy, we kill it
- **They spawn new ones** - Each failure teaches us about gaps in our cultural armor

---

## The Meta-Principle

**Cross-cutting concerns are culture as code.**

They represent our attempt to encode good judgment into reusable systems. When they work, they fade into the background. When they fail, they teach us about the gaps between our principles and our practice.

The ultimate success metric: Team members instinctively apply these safeguards without being reminded to do so.
