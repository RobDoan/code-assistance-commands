- [ ] Blue-Green
- [ ] Feature Flag (specify groups: _______)

**Rollout Stages:**
1. **Stage 1:** [Description] - [Duration/Percentage]  
   *Example: Deploy to 5% of users in region US-WEST for 30 minutes*
2. **Stage 2:** [Description] - [Duration/Percentage]  
3. **Stage 3:** [Description] - [Duration/Percentage]  

## Success Criteria

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
| Metric | Baseline | Success Threshold | Alert Threshold |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| P99 Latency | [value] | < [value] | > [value] |
| Error Rate | [value] | < [value] | > [value] |
| Throughput | [value] | > [value] | < [value] |
| [Custom Metric] | [value] | [threshold] | [threshold] |

*Example: P99 Latency baseline: 200ms, Success: <250ms, Alert: >400ms*

## Rollback Criteria

**Automatic Rollback Triggers:**
