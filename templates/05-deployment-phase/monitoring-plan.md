## Rollback Triggers

### Automatic Rollback Conditions
- [ ] **Error rate >1%** for 5 consecutive minutes
- [ ] **P99 latency >1000ms** for 10 consecutive minutes
- [ ] **Health check failures >50%** for 3 minutes
- [ ] **Database timeout rate >5%** for 5 minutes
- [ ] **Memory usage >95%** for 10 minutes

*Example: Auto-rollback if mobile app crash rate increases by >30% within first hour*

### Manual Rollback Decision Points
- [ ] **T+15 minutes:** Initial health assessment
  - Go/No-Go based on error rates and latency

| Third-party API | 100ms P95 | ___ms | >200ms |

## Logging and Observability

### Log Monitoring
**Critical Log Patterns to Watch:**
- `ERROR` level logs: Should not increase >50% from baseline
- `FATAL` level logs: Any occurrence triggers immediate alert
- Specific error patterns: `[List key error messages to monitor]`
- Performance warnings: Response time >1s, database query >500ms

**Log Aggregation:**
- **Tool:** [e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, Datadog]
- **Query Examples:**
  ```
  # Find deployment-related errors
  timestamp:[now-1h TO now] AND level:ERROR AND (deployment OR rollout)
  
  # Monitor authentication failures
  timestamp:[now-1h TO now] AND service:auth AND status:failed
  ```

### Distributed Tracing
- **Tool:** [e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray]
- **Key Traces to Monitor:**
  - User authentication flow
  - Payment processing pipeline
  - Data retrieval operations
  - Background job processing

### Synthetic Monitoring
```bash
# API health check script
#!/bin/bash
for endpoint in "/health" "/api/v1/status" "/api/v1/users/me"; do
  response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code},%{time_total}" \
    "https://api.yourapp.com$endpoint")
  echo "$endpoint: $response"
done
```
