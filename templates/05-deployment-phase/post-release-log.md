# Post-Release Observations Log

*This is a simple, chronological log of observations during and after releases. Add anything noteworthy.*

**Purpose:** Capture deployment insights, issues, and improvements for future releases.

🛡️ **BLAMELESS LEARNING ZONE** 🛡️
This log is for learning and pattern recognition, not fault attribution. Focus on "what happened" and "how to improve," never "who did what wrong." The goal is to make the next deployment safer and smoother.

### Why We Log

Every deployment—successful or challenging—teaches us something about our systems. This log serves three critical purposes:

1. **Pattern Recognition:** Spotting recurring issues before they become systemic problems
2. **Collective Intelligence:** Sharing knowledge so the entire team learns from each experience
3. **Continuous Improvement:** Converting today's surprises into tomorrow's runbook updates

Remember: The most valuable entries often come from the smoothest deployments—they reveal what's working and should be protected.

## Example Entries

### Release: auth-service - v1.5.2 - 2024-03-15

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Duration:** 25 minutes
**Result:** Success

**Timeline:**

- **14:00** - `@sarah` - Deployment started. Canary at 10%. All pre-checks passed.
- **14:05** - `@sarah` - P99 latency holding steady at 120ms. Error rate at 0.05%. Looking good.
- **14:10** - `@mike` - Noticed minor increase in DB connections (75 → 82), but well within limits.
- **14:10** - `@sarah` - Promoting to 100%. Canary metrics stable.
- **14:20** - `@sarah` - Full rollout complete. All metrics nominal.
- **14:25** - `@sarah` - Final health check passed. Deployment complete.

**Key Learnings:**

- New connection pooling logic slightly increased DB connections but stayed within bounds
- Canary monitoring window of 10 minutes felt right for this change size
- Dashboard response time queries were perfect - no guesswork on thresholds

**Action Items:**

- Update DB connection monitoring threshold from 100 to 90 (closer to observed usage)
- Consider adding connection pool efficiency metric to dashboard

### Release: payment-service - v2.1.0 - 2024-03-10

**Risk Level:** High
**Duration:** 15 minutes (rollback)
**Result:** Rollback

**Timeline:**

- **10:00** - `@alex` - Deployment started. High risk due to payment flow changes.
- **10:05** - `@alex` - Canary deployed. Initial metrics look normal.
- **10:08** - `@alex` - 🚨 Error rate spiked to 3% on /payment/process endpoint
- **10:09** - `@alex` - Investigating... seeing "connection timeout" errors to payment gateway
- **10:10** - `@alex` - Timeout pattern suggests config issue. Rolling back immediately.
- **10:12** - `@alex` - Rollback command executed
- **10:15** - `@alex` - Rollback verified. Error rate back to 0.02% baseline.

**Key Learnings:**

- Payment gateway connection timeout was caused by missing TLS cert in new version
- Pre-deployment check should include actual payment gateway connectivity test
- 3-minute detection window was good - caught before customer impact

**Action Items:**

- Add payment gateway connectivity test to runbook pre-deployment checklist
- Create synthetic transaction test for payment flow
- Update payment service runbook with gateway-specific troubleshooting

### Release: user-service - v1.3.1 - 2024-03-08

**Risk Level:** Low
**Duration:** 18 minutes
**Result:** Success

**Timeline:**

- **16:30** - `@jen` - Minor bugfix deployment. Low risk.
- **16:35** - `@jen` - Canary looks perfect. Latency actually improved (200ms → 180ms).
- **16:40** - `@jen` - Full rollout. Performance improvement holding.
- **16:48** - `@jen` - All checks passed. Nice performance boost from the DB query optimization.

**Key Learnings:**

- Query optimization had bigger impact than expected - 10% latency improvement
- Low-risk deployments still benefit from canary approach for performance validation

**Action Items:**

- Document query optimization technique for other services
- Consider similar optimization in auth-service (similar query patterns)

## Quick Reference

### Common Rollback Reasons

- Error rate spike (> 2% for 3+ minutes)
- Latency degradation (> 2x baseline)
- Health check failures
- Database connection issues
- External service integration failures

### Typical Timeline Patterns

- **Low Risk:** 10-15 minutes (5min canary, 5min full, 5min verification)
- **Medium Risk:** 20-30 minutes (10min canary, 10min full, 10min verification)
- **High Risk:** 30-45 minutes (15min canary, 15min full, 15min verification)

### Successful Deployment Indicators

- Error rate stable or improved
- Latency within 20% of baseline
- No log error pattern changes
- All health endpoints responding
- Resource usage within normal bounds
