# Problem Validation Sprint: `[Problem Area]`

**Sprint Duration:** `[3-5 days]`  
**Owner:** `[Name]`  
**Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`  
**Problem Hypothesis ID:** `[Link to hypothesis-list.md #X]`

## Our Guiding Principles

> üîç **Our mission is to find pain, not validate solutions.** We are not looking for feature ideas or validation for our solution. We are looking for evidence that a specific problem is so acute that people are already trying (and failing) to solve it. We must be dispassionate detectives, not hopeful salespeople. A "No-Go" decision based on evidence is a huge win.

---

## 1. The Problem Hypothesis

**We believe that** `[User segment - e.g., freelance designers]`  
**Struggles with** `[the problem - e.g., getting timely client feedback on designs]`  
**Which causes them to feel** `[core emotion - e.g., anxious, frustrated, incompetent]`  
**We will know this is true when we observe** `[specific behavior - e.g., they use messy email threads and multiple tools]`

**Example:**
*We believe that **freelance graphic designers** struggle with **getting timely, actionable feedback from clients** which causes them to feel **anxious and professionally incompetent** and we will know this is true when we observe **they use complex workarounds like email chains, multiple revision tracking methods, and frequent follow-up calls***

**Riskiest Assumption:** *That this problem ranks in their top 3 professional frustrations*

## 2. Go/No-Go Criteria (The Kill Switch)

*We define success BEFORE we start. Be brutally honest.*

### ‚úÖ GO (Problem Validated) if ALL of the following are met

- [ ] **Emotional Pain:** >7/10 interviewees describe strong emotional reactions (frustrated, anxious, angry)
- [ ] **Active Behavior:** >5/10 show us current "hacky" workarounds they use
- [ ] **Recent Action:** >3/10 have actively searched for or tried solutions in past 3 months
- [ ] **Frequency:** >5/10 encounter this problem weekly or more often

### ‚ùå NO-GO (Problem Invalidated) if ANY of the following are true

- Problem consistently described as "minor annoyance" or "would be nice"
- Most users say "I just live with it" with no emotion
- Existing free/good-enough solutions frequently mentioned
- Problem happens less than monthly for most users

### ‚ö†Ô∏è INCONCLUSIVE (Need More Data) if

- Mixed results across segments
- Small sample size (n<8 interviews)
- Contradictory qualitative and quantitative signals

---

## 3. Sprint Plan (Max 5 Days)

### Day 1: Desk Research (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Scan Reddit, Discord, forums for complaints about this problem

- [ ] Document initial findings

### Day 2-3: Problem Interviews (5-10 interviews, 20-30 min each)

- [ ] Recruit participants from target segment
- [ ] Conduct "Problem Interviews" using script below
- [ ] Focus on listening for emotional language and behaviors
- [ ] Document quotes and observed workarounds immediately

### Day 4: Evidence Synthesis

- [ ] Calculate percentages against Go/No-Go criteria
- [ ] Identify patterns and surprising insights
- [ ] Prepare recommendation

### Day 5: Decision & Next Steps

- [ ] Team decision meeting (30 min max)
- [ ] Update hypothesis-list.md with results
- [ ] Plan next problem sprint OR solution sprint

## 4. The Problem Interview Script (Listen, Don't Pitch)

*Keep it conversational. We're detectives gathering evidence.*

### Opening (2 min)

*"Hi [Name], thanks for your time. I'm researching challenges that [user segment] face with [broad topic]. I'm not selling anything - I just want to learn from your experience. There are no right or wrong answers."*

### Context Setting (5 min)

1. **Recent Experience:** *"Tell me about the last time you dealt with [topic area]."*
2. **Walk Me Through:** *"Can you walk me through exactly what happened?"*

### Pain Discovery (15 min)

3. **Frustration Probe:** *"What was the most frustrating part of that process?"*
4. **Emotional Impact:** *"How did that make you feel when it happened?"* *(Listen for: stupid, anxious, frustrated, angry)*
5. **Frequency:** *"How often does this kind of thing happen?"*
6. **Impact Quantification:** *"How much time/money does this typically cost you?"*
7. **Consequence Test:** *"What happens if you just ignore this problem?"* *(Listen for: nothing vs. serious consequences)*

### Behavior Investigation (8 min)

8. **Current Solutions:** *"What have you tried to do to solve this?"* *(Most important question!)*
9. **Show Me:** *"Can you show me how you handle this today?"* *(Look for workarounds)*
10. **Recent Actions:** *"Have you looked for solutions to this recently? What did you find?"*

### Pain Ranking & Urgency (5 min)

11. **Priority Ranking:** *"Compared to other work challenges, how would you rank this problem?"*
12. **Hair on Fire Scale:** *"On a scale from 'minor leak' to 'hair on fire,' how urgent is solving this for you?"*

### Wrap-up (2 min)

13. **Magic Wand:** *"If you could wave a magic wand and make one change to fix this, what would it be?"*
14. **Referrals:** *"Who else do you know who struggles with this same issue?"*

---

## 5. The Evidence Locker

*No opinions, just data and direct quotes. Fill this out during/after interviews.*

### Quantitative Evidence

| Metric | Target | Actual | Pass/Fail |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| % Showing Strong Emotional Reaction | >70% | */10 (*%)|  |
| % Using Workarounds Currently | >50% | */10 (*%)|  |
| % Actively Sought Solution (3 months) | >30% | */10 (*%)|  |
| % Experience Weekly or More | >50% | */10 (*%)|  |
| Average "Hair on Fire" Score (1-5) | >3.5 | [Score] |  |

### Most Damning Quotes (Evidence of Pain)

*Copy exact words, note participant ID*

1. *"I feel like an idiot every time I have to ask three times for feedback. It makes me look unprofessional." - P3*
2. *"[Quote showing emotional impact]" - P[#]*
3. *"[Quote showing emotional impact]" - P[#]*

### Observed Workarounds (Evidence of Motivation)

*Document the messy solutions they're already using*

1. *P5 showed me a 15-tab spreadsheet tracking feedback from 8 clients across 4 different communication channels*
2. *P2 pays for Slack, Figma comments, AND email templates just to manage client communication*
3. *[Workaround description] - P[#]*

### Surprising Discovery

*What did we learn that we didn't expect?*

- *Example: The problem is 3x worse for designers working with enterprise clients vs. small business*
- *Example: Users care more about communication clarity than speed*

---

## 6. The Verdict

### Decision: ‚úÖ GO / ‚ùå NO-GO / ‚ö†Ô∏è INCONCLUSIVE

### One-Sentence Summary

*Example: "The problem is validated - designers experience genuine anxiety about client communication and are cobbling together inadequate solutions."*  

OR

*Example: "The problem is invalidated - while a minor annoyance, users are satisfied with email and don't feel urgency to change."*

### Evidence Summary

**What validated our hypothesis:**

- *8/10 used words like "frustrated," "anxious," or "embarrassing"*
- *9/10 showed current workarounds (complex tracking systems)*
- *6/10 had searched for solutions in past 3 months*

**What surprised us:**

- *Enterprise clients are the source of 80% of the frustration*
- *Timing matters more than content quality*

**What invalidated our assumptions:**

- *Only 3/10 encounter this weekly (we thought it was daily)*
- *Most see this as client relationship issue, not tool problem*

## 7. Next Steps

### If ‚úÖ GO (Problem Validated)

1. [ ] **Immediate:** Add "Solution Hypothesis" to `hypothesis-list.md`

## 8. Sprint Retrospective

### What Worked Well
