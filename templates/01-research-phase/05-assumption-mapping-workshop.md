# Assumption & Opportunity Mapping Workshop

**Meeting Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Facilitator:** `[Product Manager/Team Lead]`  
**Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`  
**Attendees:** `[Core team - PM, Designer, Engineer, Data]`

**Prerequisites:** Completed Research Experiment Summary with validated problems and user insights

---

## Our Philosophy

> üíé **Your research gave you a mountain of raw material (insights, quotes, observations). Your job now is to mine that mountain for the most volatile, dangerous materials (your riskiest assumptions) and design small, controlled explosions (experiments) to see what happens.**

> üéØ **The goal isn't to validate what we hope is true - it's to find our most dangerous "leaps of faith" and test them before they kill the business.**

---

## Workshop Overview

This workshop bridges the gap between research insights and named experiments for Design Phase. You'll transform validated problems into a prioritized queue of testable assumptions.

**Input:** Research findings, insights, validated problems  
**Output:** Named experiments ranked by impact/certainty, ready for Design Phase

---

## Step 1: Brainstorm All Your "Leaps of Faith" (15 mins)

### Instructions

Go through your Research Experiment Summary, user insights, and problem validation findings. For each key insight, reframe it as a belief statement starting with **"We believe..."**

**Format:** Transform observations into assumptions

| Research Insight | ‚Üí | Assumption (Belief) |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| *"Users said they find creating monthly reports tedious"* | ‚Üí | *"We believe users find report creation so painful they would pay to automate it"* |
| *"Most potential users are solo entrepreneurs"* | ‚Üí | *"We believe solo entrepreneurs have the budget for a $20/month tool"* |
| *"People use 3 different tools to get the data they need"* | ‚Üí | *"We believe users will value an all-in-one solution enough to switch from their current tools"* |

### Your "We Believe..." Statements

**Problem Assumptions:**
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about the problem/pain point]`
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about problem frequency/severity]`
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about who has this problem]`

**Solution Assumptions:**
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about what solution users want]`
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about solution approach/features]`
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about user adoption behavior]`

**Business Model Assumptions:**
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about willingness to pay]`
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about pricing model]`
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about market size/conversion]`

**Technical Assumptions:**
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about technical feasibility]`
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about performance/scale requirements]`
- [ ] We believe `[assumption about integration needs]`

**Target:** 15-30 "We believe..." statements total

## Step 2: Map Your Assumptions on the Risk Matrix (30 mins)

### The Impact/Certainty Matrix

Draw a 2x2 matrix (use Miro, Figjam, or whiteboard):

```
HIGH IMPACT    |  Strengths     |  EXPERIMENTS
               |  (protect)     |  (test first!)
               |                |
LOW IMPACT     |  Ignore        |  Facts
               |  (for now)     |  (don't test)
               |                |
             LOW              HIGH
           CERTAINTY        CERTAINTY
```

### Axis Definitions

**X-Axis: Certainty** (How much evidence supports this belief?)
- **Low Certainty (Left):** Total guess, no data, assumptions based on hope
- **High Certainty (Right):** Strong evidence from research, multiple data points, validated

**Y-Axis: Impact** (If this belief is wrong, how bad is it?)
- **Low Impact (Bottom):** We can work around it, doesn't break the business
- **High Impact (Top):** Business fails if this assumption is false

### Mapping Instructions

**As a team, place each "We believe..." statement on the matrix:**

1. **Read the assumption aloud**
2. **Debate certainty:** What evidence do we have? How strong is it?
3. **Debate impact:** What happens to the business if this is completely wrong?
4. **Place on matrix:** Discuss until team agrees on placement
5. **Repeat for all assumptions**

### Example Placements

**Top-Left (High Impact, Low Certainty) - EXPERIMENT ZONE:**
- "We believe users will pay $50/month for this solution" ‚Üê NO DATA, KILLS BUSINESS IF WRONG

**Top-Right (High Impact, High Certainty) - STRENGTHS:**
- "We believe users hate manual data entry" ‚Üê STRONG RESEARCH, CRITICAL INSIGHT

**Bottom-Right (Low Impact, High Certainty) - FACTS:**
- "We believe our target users use Excel" ‚Üê CONFIRMED, BUT NOT CRITICAL

**Bottom-Left (Low Impact, Low Certainty) - IGNORE:**
- "We believe users prefer blue buttons" ‚Üê GUESS, BUT WHO CARES?

## Step 3: Identify Your Core Experiments (15 mins)

### Focus on the Top-Left Quadrant

**These are your "Leaps of Faith" - assumptions that are:**
- High Impact (business fails if wrong)
- Low Certainty (little to no evidence)

**This is your experiment queue.** Prioritize by:
1. **Distance from top-left corner** (furthest = most dangerous)
2. **Speed to test** (can we get an answer in days vs. months?)
3. **Cost to be wrong** (what's the business impact if we're wrong?)

### Your Experiment Queue

**Priority 1 (Most Dangerous):**
- **Assumption:** `[The scariest belief in top-left corner]`
- **Why Dangerous:** `[What happens to business if this is false]`
- **Evidence Level:** `[What little evidence we have, if any]`

**Priority 2:**
- **Assumption:** `[Second most dangerous belief]`
- **Why Dangerous:** `[Business impact]`
- **Evidence Level:** `[Current evidence]`

**Priority 3:**
- **Assumption:** `[Third most dangerous belief]`
- **Why Dangerous:** `[Business impact]`
- **Evidence Level:** `[Current evidence]`

## Step 4: Name Your Experiments (20 mins)

### Experiment Naming Formula

**[Verb] + [The Assumption Being Tested]**

Transform each prioritized assumption into an experiment name:

| Priority | Assumption | ‚Üí | Experiment Name |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| 1 | "We believe users find report creation so painful they would pay to automate it" | ‚Üí | **"Test Willingness-to-Pay for Automated Reporting"** |
| 2 | "We believe solo entrepreneurs have budget for $20/month tools" | ‚Üí | **"Validate Budget Availability for $20/Month Tool"** |
| 3 | "We believe users will switch from 3 tools to use our all-in-one solution" | ‚Üí | **"Test Tool-Switching Intent for All-in-One Solution"** |

### Your Named Experiments

**Experiment #1: `[Name using formula above]`**
- **Assumption Being Tested:** `[Copy from Priority 1 above]`
- **Success Metric:** `[How will we know if assumption is true?]`
- **Kill Criteria:** `[What result would prove us wrong?]`
- **Estimated Time to Test:** `[Days/weeks to get reliable signal]`

**Experiment #2: `[Name using formula above]`**
- **Assumption Being Tested:** `[Copy from Priority 2 above]`
- **Success Metric:** `[How will we know if assumption is true?]`
- **Kill Criteria:** `[What result would prove us wrong?]`
- **Estimated Time to Test:** `[Days/weeks to get reliable signal]`

**Experiment #3: `[Name using formula above]`**
- **Assumption Being Tested:** `[Copy from Priority 3 above]`
- **Success Metric:** `[How will we know if assumption is true?]`
- **Kill Criteria:** `[What result would prove us wrong?]`
- **Estimated Time to Test:** `[Days/weeks to get reliable signal]`

## Step 5: Final Prioritization & Next Steps (10 mins)

### The Final Decision

**Which experiment should we run first?**

Consider:
- **Danger Level:** Which assumption could kill the business fastest?
- **Speed to Answer:** Which can we test in the shortest time?
- **Learning Value:** Which teaches us the most about our business model?
- **Resource Cost:** Which requires the least investment to test?

**Our First Experiment:** `[Final choice with rationale]`

**Rationale:** `[Why this experiment beats the others for first priority]`

### Immediate Next Steps

**Today:**
- [ ] **Update `00-hypothesis-list.md`** with new solution hypotheses from workshop
- [ ] **Schedule Design Phase kickoff** for first experiment (within 48 hours)
- [ ] **Assign experiment owner** for first experiment

**This Week:**
- [ ] **Start Tech Spike Check** for first experiment (`../02-design-phase/00-tech-spike-check.md`)
- [ ] **Begin Experiment Brief** for first experiment (`../02-design-phase/01-experiment-brief.md`)

**Next 2 Weeks:**
- [ ] **Complete Design Phase** for first experiment
- [ ] **Plan experiments #2 and #3** based on learnings from first experiment
