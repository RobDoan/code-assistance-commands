## 1. Market Opportunities & Unmet Needs

*What trends, market shifts, or underserved needs create an opening for us? Focus on what customers are complaining about publicly. Spend no more than 2 hours on this section.*

- **Opportunity 1:** *Example: The shift to remote work has made time-tracking and boundary-setting more acute for knowledge workers.*
- **Opportunity 2:** *Example: Customers of Competitor X are complaining about their new pricing model on Twitter and Reddit.*
- **Opportunity 3:** *Example: New AI capabilities (GPT-4) make solving document parsing in a new way possible.*
- **Opportunity 4:** *Example: Recent regulation changes require businesses to track carbon footprint - no simple solution exists.*

**Evidence Sources:** *Example: Twitter complaints, Reddit threads, G2 reviews, Customer interviews*

## 2. Competitor Teardown (Max 3 Competitors)

*For each key competitor, focus only on what matters: their weaknesses and the assumptions they rely on. Spend max 1 hour per competitor.*

### Competitor A: `[Company Name]`

- **Apparent Strategy:** *Example: Dominate the enterprise market with an all-in-one, complex solution.*
- **Exploitable Weaknesses:**
  - *Example: Onboarding takes 2+ weeks and requires consultants.*
  - *Example: Mobile app is an afterthought with 2.3 star rating.*
  - *Example: Pricing is opaque and starts at $50k/year.*
- **Their Core Assumptions (What must be true for them to succeed?):**
  - *Example: Companies are willing to invest heavily in a long implementation process.*
  - *Example: The buyer (CIO) is not the end-user, so UX is secondary.*
  - *Example: Enterprises value feature completeness over ease of use.*

### Competitor B: `[Company Name]`

- **Apparent Strategy:** *Example: Product-led growth targeting individual developers.*
- **Exploitable Weaknesses:**
  - *Example: Lacks features for team collaboration.*
  - *Example: No clear path to scale from single user to company-wide solution.*
  - *Example: Limited to 3 integrations on free tier, frustrating users.*
- **Their Core Assumptions:**
  - *Example: Individual developers will adopt tools and bring them into work bottom-up.*
  - *Example: Users prioritize beautiful UI over powerful integrations.*
  - *Example: Freemium model will naturally convert to paid at scale.*

### Competitor C: `[Company Name]`

- **Apparent Strategy:** *[Strategy description]*
- **Exploitable Weaknesses:**
  - *[Weakness 1]*
  - *[Weakness 2]*
- **Their Core Assumptions:**
  - *[Assumption 1]*
  - *[Assumption 2]*

## 3. Our Unfair Advantages

*What do we have that others can't easily copy? Be honest - if you don't have any yet, that's OK.*

- **Existing Advantage:** *Example: Founder's 10-year network in target industry*
- **Existing Advantage:** *Example: Proprietary dataset from previous company*
- **Potential Advantage:** *Example: If we move fast, we could be first to market with X*
- **Potential Advantage:** *Example: Partnership opportunity with Y that competitors don't have*

## 4. Actionable Hypotheses

*Based on the opportunities and weaknesses identified above, what will we test? Each of these should be added to the `hypothesis-list.md`. Limit to top 3-5.*

### Hypothesis #1 (Exploit Opportunity 1)
- **We believe that** a mobile-first solution for time-tracking
- **For** remote workers frustrated with Competitor A's desktop-only approach
- **Will achieve** 20% week-over-week user growth
- **We will know this is true when** a landing page offering early access gets 15% email sign-up rate
- **Test Method:** Landing page with mockups and "Get Early Access" CTA
- **Timeline:** Launch test within 48 hours
- **Link to hypothesis-list.md:** `[Hypothesis #X]`

### Hypothesis #2 (Attack Competitor B's Weakness)
- **We believe that** adding team collaboration to a simple developer tool
- **For** growing startups currently using Competitor B
- **Will achieve** viral team adoption
- **We will know this is true when** 5 beta teams each invite 3+ users within 2 weeks
- **Test Method:** Manual onboarding of 5 target companies for concierge MVP
- **Timeline:** Start outreach today
- **Link to hypothesis-list.md:** `[Hypothesis #Y]`

### Hypothesis #3 (Leverage Market Shift)
- **We believe that** *[Specific solution approach]*
- **For** *[Target segment affected by shift]*
- **Will achieve** *[Measurable outcome]*
- **We will know this is true when** *[Specific success metric]*
- **Test Method:** *[How we'll test quickly]*
- **Timeline:** *[When we'll start]*
- **Link to hypothesis-list.md:** `[Hypothesis #Z]`

## 5. Quick Wins to Pursue Now

*What can we do THIS WEEK to start learning? No analysis paralysis.*

1. **Today:** Set up landing page test for Hypothesis #1
2. **Tomorrow:** Reach out to 10 potential beta users for Hypothesis #2
3. **This Week:** Create mockups showing our approach vs Competitor A's complexity
4. **This Week:** Start tracking Competitor B's user complaints in a simple spreadsheet

---

## 6. What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

*Be explicit about what we're choosing to ignore for now.*

- **Not Building:** Full feature parity with Competitor A (too slow, not our advantage)
- **Not Targeting:** Enterprise segment (Competitor A owns this, we'll attack from below)
- **Not Prioritizing:** International markets (focus on proving model in US first)

## Landscape Evolution Log

*Track how our understanding changes with new data. This is where your assumptions meet reality.*

### Change History
| Date | What Changed | Why (What We Learned) | Impact on Strategy |
|------|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| *[YYYY-MM-DD]* | *Initial analysis* | *Starting assumptions* | *Baseline strategy* |
| *[YYYY-MM-DD]* | *Ex: Competitor A not as slow as thought* | *They shipped mobile app in 2 weeks* | *Can't rely on speed advantage alone* |
| *[YYYY-MM-DD]* | *Ex: Opportunity #2 invalidated* | *Users don't actually care about X* | *Pivot to opportunity #3* |
| *[YYYY-MM-DD]* | *Ex: Competitor B got $50M funding* | *Public announcement* | *Now primary threat, not secondary* |

### Key Assumption Tracker
✅ **Validated:** 
- *Competitor A's enterprise focus leaves SMB market open*

❌ **Invalidated:**
- *Users will switch from Competitor A easily (they're more locked-in than expected)*

❓ **Still Testing:**
- *Competitor B can't scale their manual processes*
