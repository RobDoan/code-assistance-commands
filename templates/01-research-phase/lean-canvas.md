# Lean Canvas: `[Product Name]`

**Owner:** `[Name]`  
**Version:** `[v1.0 - Initial assumptions]` / `[v1.1 - Post-customer interviews]` / `[v2.0 - Post-MVP]`  
**Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This entire canvas is a set of assumptions, not a business plan.** The goal is not to be right, but to find out what's wrong as quickly as possible. Each box represents a belief to be tested.

## Riskiest Assumptions to Test First

*These beliefs, if proven false, would kill the business. Test them NOW.*

### üî¥ Critical Assumption #1
**Assumption:** *Freelancers are willing to pay $29/month for invoice management*  
**Test:** Landing page with pricing, measure "Start Free Trial" clicks  
**Success Criteria:** >5% conversion to click  
**Timeline:** Launch within 48 hours  
**Hypothesis Link:** `[‚Üí Hypothesis #1 in hypothesis-list.md]`

### üî¥ Critical Assumption #2  
**Assumption:** *Our solution actually reduces payment time by 50%*  
**Test:** Manual concierge MVP with 10 beta users  
**Success Criteria:** Average payment time drops from 30 to 15 days  
**Timeline:** 2-week pilot starting Monday  
**Hypothesis Link:** `[‚Üí Hypothesis #2 in hypothesis-list.md]`

### üü° Important Assumption #3
**Assumption:** *Users will connect their email for auto-import*  
**Test:** Mockup showing email permission screen, measure drop-off  
**Success Criteria:** <20% abandon at permission step  
**Timeline:** Test during beta onboarding  
**Hypothesis Link:** `[‚Üí Hypothesis #3 in hypothesis-list.md]`

## Key Metrics Dashboard

*What numbers tell us if we're on track? Focus on actionable metrics, not vanity metrics.*

### üìä Primary Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target (3 mo) | Target (12 mo) | How We Measure |
|---------|---------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Activation Rate** | *0%* | *40%* | *60%* | *% who send first invoice* |
| **30-Day Retention** | *0%* | *65%* | *75%* | *% still active after 30d* |
| **CAC** | *$0* | *<$100* | *<$75* | *Total spend / signups* |
| **LTV** | *$0* | *>$500* | *>$1500* | *ARPU √ó avg lifetime* |
| **Viral Coefficient** | *0* | *0.3* | *0.7* | *Invites sent √ó conversion* |

### üö¶ Health Indicators
- **Burn Rate:** $[X]/month ‚Üí Runway: [Y] months
- **Growth Rate:** [Z]% MoM (Target: >20%)
- **Unit Economics:** LTV:CAC ratio = [Ratio] (Target: >3:1)

## Canvas Evolution

*How has our understanding changed? Track major pivots and learnings.*

### Version History
| Version | Date | Major Changes | What We Learned |
|---------|------|---------------|------------------|
| v1.0 | *[Date]* | *Initial assumptions* | *Starting point* |
| v1.1 | *[Date]* | *Narrowed segment from SMBs to freelancers* | *SMBs have longer sales cycles* |
| v1.2 | *[Date]* | *Dropped enterprise tier* | *Not ready for enterprise complexity* |
| v2.0 | *[Date]* | *Pivot to mobile-first* | *60% usage on mobile devices* |

### Validated Changes
‚úÖ **What we got right:**
- *Payment delays are a real pain point (confirmed by 15/15 interviews)*
- *Freelancers segment is underserved (competitor analysis confirmed)*

### Invalidated Assumptions
‚ùå **What we got wrong:**
- *Originally thought AI features were key ‚Üí Users want simplicity*
- *Assumed desktop-first ‚Üí Data shows 60% mobile usage*

### Open Questions
‚ùì **Still testing:**
- *Will users pay $29/month or prefer usage-based pricing?*
- *Can we achieve <$100 CAC through content marketing alone?*

## Next Actions

### This Week
1. [ ] Launch landing page test for pricing validation
2. [ ] Interview 5 more potential customers
3. [ ] Set up basic analytics tracking
4. [ ] **Housekeeping:** Review and update assumptions after any experiments complete

### Blocked/Waiting
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Partnership discussions - waiting on legal review
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Payment integration - need to validate willingness to pay first

### Kill Decisions
*Features/ideas we've explicitly decided NOT to pursue:*
- ‚ùå Multi-currency support (adds complexity, <5% need)
- ‚ùå White-label option (different business model)
- ‚ùå Crypto payments (regulatory complexity)

## Template Connections & Housekeeping

*This canvas should stay synchronized with other documents:*

**After completing experiments:**
- [ ] Update assumptions in "Riskiest Assumptions" section
- [ ] Move validated assumptions to "Validated Changes"
- [ ] Move invalidated assumptions to "Invalidated Assumptions"
- [ ] Increment version number and date

**Regular reviews:**
- Weekly during early stage (first 6 months)
- Bi-weekly once product-market fit is achieved
- Always update after major pivots or learnings
