### Our Guiding Principles

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This canvas is not a business plan; it is a map of our assumptions.** Its job is to expose the riskiest parts of our idea so we can test them systematically. Each box contains a **hypothesis**, not a fact. Our goal is not to create a perfect plan, but to learn faster than our competition by invalidating the wrong assumptions. Treat every entry with skepticism.

## The Hypothesis-Driven Canvas

| 1. Customer Segments & Problem | 2. Unique Value Proposition (UVP) | 3. Solution |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **SEGMENT HYPOTHESIS:**<br>We believe our ideal early adopters are:<br>*- Tech freelancers (25-40)*<br>*- Handle 5-15 clients monthly*<br><br>**PROBLEM HYPOTHESIS:**<br>They struggle with:<br>1. *Payment delays (avg 45 days)*<br>2. *Manual invoice tracking*<br><br>**EXISTING ALTERNATIVES:**<br>Today, they solve this by:<br>*- Complex spreadsheets + email*<br><br>---<br>**EVIDENCE:** `[Link to interviews/surveys]`<br>**RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:** `That payment speed is a top-3 problem for them` | **UVP HYPOTHESIS:**<br>The single message that will cut through noise is:<br>**"Get paid 2x faster with 5-minute setup"**<br><br>It's a "must-have" because it delivers:<br>*- 10+ hours saved per week*<br>*- 50% faster payments*<br><br>---<br>**EVIDENCE:** `[Link to landing page tests]`<br>**RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:** `That "speed of payment" is the #1 motivator` | **MVP HYPOTHESIS:**<br>The absolute minimum to prove our UVP:<br>1. *Auto invoice import*<br>2. *Payment status dashboard*<br><br>This is NOT:<br>*- Full accounting integration*<br>*- Multi-currency support*<br><br>---<br>**EVIDENCE:** `[Link to prototype feedback]`<br>**RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:** `That these features can deliver the promised UVP` |

| **4. Channels** | **5. Revenue Streams & Pricing** | **6. Key Metrics** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **CHANNEL HYPOTHESIS:**<br>We will reach first 100 customers through:<br>*- Direct outreach to Reddit/Discord*<br>*- Content marketing on invoicing pain*<br><br>---<br>**EVIDENCE:** `[Link to channel tests]`<br>**RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:** `That our segment hangs out on these platforms` | **PRICING HYPOTHESIS:**<br>Customers will pay:<br>*- $29/month (SaaS subscription)*<br><br>**REVENUE MODEL HYPOTHESIS:**<br>Primary model:<br>*- Per-user monthly subscription*<br><br>---<br>**EVIDENCE:** `[Link to pricing experiments]`<br>**RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:** `That customers will pay anything at all` | **THE ONE METRIC THAT MATTERS:**<br>*7-day retention rate*<br><br>**SUCCESS CRITERIA HYPOTHESIS:**<br>We're succeeding if this reaches:<br>*>40% by month-end*<br><br>---<br>**EVIDENCE:** `[Link to analytics]`<br>**RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:** `That retention predicts long-term value` |

| **7. Cost Structure** | **8. Unfair Advantage** | **9. Canvas Evolution Log** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **STARTUP COSTS (Pre-PMF):**<br>*- Dev Team: $50K/mo*<br>*- Burn Rate: $60K/mo*<br>*- Runway: 8 months*<br><br>**SCALE-UP COSTS (Post-PMF):**<br>*- CAC Hypothesis: <$100*<br>*- LTV Hypothesis: >$500*<br><br>---<br>**RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:** `That we can acquire customers for <$100` | **ADVANTAGE HYPOTHESIS:**<br>Our real, defensible advantage:<br>*- Proprietary ML trained on 1M invoices*<br><br>This is NOT:<br>*- "Being first to market"*<br>*- "Better UI design"*<br><br>---<br>**EVIDENCE:** `[Patent filed, exclusive data]`<br>**RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:** `That this advantage is hard to copy` | **v1.0 ‚Üí v1.1:**<br>*- **Pivot:** SMBs ‚Üí Freelancers*<br>*- **Learning:** SMBs have long sales cycles*<br>*- **Evidence:** `[‚Üí Problem Validation Sprint]`*<br><br>**v1.1 ‚Üí v1.2:**<br>*- **Persevere:** Pricing validated*<br>*- **Learning:** Users want trial period*<br>*- **Evidence:** `[‚Üí Experiment Summary #3]`* |

## Risk Heat Map

*Visual representation of our assumption confidence levels*

üî¥ **HIGH RISK (Test Immediately)**

- That customers will pay $29/month
- That our UVP resonates with target segment
- That we can acquire customers for <$100

üü° **MEDIUM RISK (Test Soon)**

- That 7-day retention predicts LTV
- That our advantage is defensible
- That target channels will work

üü¢ **LOW RISK (Monitor)**

- That we can build the MVP features
- That our team can execute

## Next Canvas Review

**Trigger Events for Canvas Update:**

- [ ] Complete any experiment with VALIDATED or INVALIDATED result
- [ ] Major market shift or competitor move
- [ ] Pivot decision made
- [ ] Monthly review (minimum cadence)

**Last Major Change:** `[Date and brief description]`  
**Next Scheduled Review:** `[Date]`

## Template Synchronization

*Keep these documents aligned:*

**After updating this canvas:**

- [ ] Sync riskiest assumptions with `hypothesis-list.md` backlog
- [ ] Update strategic direction in `opportunity-landscape.md`
- [ ] Ensure problem validation aligns with `problem-validation-sprint.md`

**This canvas should be updated after:**

- [ ] Any experiment summary shows VALIDATED/INVALIDATED result
- [ ] Problem validation sprint concludes
- [ ] Major strategic pivot discussion
