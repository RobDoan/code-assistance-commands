# Research Phase: Turning Guesses into Hypotheses

> **"We believe this problem exists, and here's how we'll find out if we're wrong."**
>
> Research isn't about proving ourselves right - it's about getting less wrong, faster.

## Our Philosophy

Research Phase embodies the **Learning Machine Manifesto**:

- **🎯 Assume Nothing, Test Everything** - Every assumption becomes a testable hypothesis
- **🚀 Seek Velocity, Not Perfection** - 3-day problem validation beats 3-month market analysis  
- **📊 Data Over Drama** - We separate what we observe from what we wish were true
- **💀 Celebrate Funerals** - Killing bad assumptions early saves months of wasted effort

## The Research Toolkit

### 🔍 **Problem Validation Sprint**

*[problem-validation-sprint.md](problem-validation-sprint.md)*

**When to Use:** Before building anything, validate the problem exists

**The Problem It Solves:** Teams build solutions for problems that don't actually exist

**3 AM Test Question:** *"How do we know this problem is worth solving?"*

### 💡 **Hypothesis List**

*[hypothesis-list.md](hypothesis-list.md)*

**When to Use:** Convert every assumption into testable statements

**The Problem It Solves:** Assumptions hide as facts until they break our product

**3 AM Test Question:** *"What are we assuming that we haven't tested?"*

### 🗺️ **Lean Canvas**

*[03-lean-canvas.md](03-lean-canvas.md)*

**When to Use:** Map your business model assumptions on one page

**The Problem It Solves:** Complex business plans that nobody reads or updates

**3 AM Test Question:** *"What's our riskiest business assumption?"*

### 🌄 **Opportunity Landscape**

*[opportunity-landscape.md](opportunity-landscape.md)*

**When to Use:** Find exploitable gaps in 3 hours instead of 3 months of analysis

**The Problem It Solves:** Analysis paralysis that delays customer contact

**3 AM Test Question:** *"Where can we win that others can't?"*

### 📋 **Experiment Summary**

*[experiment-summary.md](experiment-summary.md)*

**When to Use:** After every research experiment to capture learning

**The Problem It Solves:** Learning gets lost instead of feeding future decisions

**3 AM Test Question:** *"What did we learn that changes what we do next?"*

## Research Anti-Patterns We Avoid

### 📚 **Analysis Paralysis**

- **The Trap:** Researching competitors instead of talking to customers
- **The Reality:** You learn more from 5 customer interviews than 50 competitor analyses
- **Safeguard:** 3-day sprint limit on any research activity

### 🎯 **Confirmation Bias Research**

- **The Trap:** Looking for data that supports what we want to build
- **The Reality:** We should try to prove ourselves wrong, not right
- **Safeguard:** State the null hypothesis first in every research plan

### 📄 **Perfect Plan Syndrome**

- **The Trap:** Creating comprehensive research documents instead of quick tests
- **The Reality:** An imperfect test beats a perfect plan
- **Safeguard:** If you can't test it in a week, break it down further

## The Research Flow

```
Problem Signal → Hypothesis → Quick Test → Learn → Decide
      ↑                                            ↓
      ←─────── New Questions ←─────────────────────
```

### Phase Gate Questions

Before moving to Design Phase, answer these:

1. **Problem Validation:** Have we confirmed this problem exists and is painful?
2. **Market Validation:** Have we found customers willing to pay for a solution?
3. **Solution Fit:** Have we validated our approach resonates with the target market?
4. **Competitive Intelligence:** Do we understand where we can win vs. existing solutions?
5. **Next Riskiest Assumption:** What's the most dangerous thing we still believe without testing?

## Research Workflow Guide

### Week 1: Problem Discovery

1. **Start with [Problem Validation Sprint](problem-validation-sprint.md)**
   - Define the problem hypothesis
   - Interview 10+ potential customers
   - Look for evidence the problem is urgent and expensive

2. **Create [Hypothesis List](hypothesis-list.md)**
   - List every assumption about problem, customer, market
   - Rank by risk and testability
   - Define what would prove each hypothesis wrong

### Week 2: Market Understanding  

3. **Map [Opportunity Landscape](opportunity-landscape.md)**
   - Find competitors and adjacent solutions
   - Identify market gaps and positioning opportunities
   - Validate market size assumptions

4. **Build [Lean Canvas](lean-canvas.md)**
   - Map all business model assumptions
   - Identify the riskiest components
   - Plan tests for each assumption

### Week 3: Solution Validation

5. **Test Solution Hypotheses**
   - Show mockups, not build products
   - Measure intent, not opinions
   - Look for behavior, not words

6. **Complete [Experiment Summary](experiment-summary.md)**
   - Document what you learned vs. what you hoped
   - Identify validated vs. invalidated assumptions
   - Define next most dangerous assumption to test

## Integration with Other Phases

### To Design Phase

- **Validated problem** becomes design requirements
- **User insights** inform user experience decisions  
- **Market positioning** guides product positioning
- **Technical constraints** influence architecture choices

### Cross-Cutting Connections

- **Red Team Review:** Challenge research methodology and bias
- **Failure Celebration:** Celebrate invalidated market assumptions
- **Crisis Framework:** Maintain research rigor under pressure to ship

---

## Research Success Metrics

### Learning Velocity Indicators

- **Customer Contact Rate:** 10+ customer conversations per week
- **Assumption Testing Rate:** 3+ hypotheses tested per week  
- **Pivot Speed:** <1 week from invalidated assumption to new test
- **Research-to-Action Time:** <3 days from learning to next experiment

### Quality of Learning Signs

- Specific, actionable insights (not generic feedback)
- Behavioral evidence (not just stated preferences)
- Contradictory data that challenges assumptions
- Clear next steps based on research findings

---

## Common Research Templates Usage

### For Startups (Pre-Product Market Fit)

- Use **all templates** - you're testing everything
- Focus heavily on Problem Validation Sprint and Hypothesis List
- Update Lean Canvas weekly based on learnings
- Celebrate every invalidated assumption

### For New Features (Existing Product)

- Start with Opportunity Landscape to understand competitive context
- Use Hypothesis List for feature-specific assumptions
- Lighter touch on Lean Canvas (focus on new business model elements)
- Quick Problem Validation Sprint (3-5 customer interviews)

### For Market Expansion

- Heavy use of Opportunity Landscape for new market understanding
- Hypothesis List focused on market-specific assumptions
- Problem Validation Sprint in new customer segments
- Update relevant parts of Lean Canvas

---

## Research Team Roles

### For Product Managers

- Own the Problem Validation Sprint process
- Maintain and prioritize the Hypothesis List
- Ensure research connects to business outcomes
- Protect team from analysis paralysis

### For UX Researchers  

- Design research methodologies that minimize bias
- Focus on behavioral evidence vs. stated preferences
- Challenge team assumptions through structured research
- Make research insights actionable for design and development

### For Founders

- Model intellectual curiosity and comfort with being wrong
- Prioritize customer contact over competitor research
- Celebrate pivot decisions based on research insights
- Maintain urgency to test assumptions quickly

---

## Evolution Notes

Research templates evolve based on:

- **Speed of learning** - Templates that slow down customer contact get simplified
- **Quality of insights** - Methods that generate shallow insights get replaced
- **Action rate** - Research that doesn't lead to decisions gets questioned
- **Team adoption** - Complex templates get streamlined based on actual usage

---

## The Research Manifesto

**We are assumption hunters, not confirmation seekers.**

- We talk to customers more than we research competitors
- We test behavior more than we ask opinions  
- We celebrate being wrong more than we celebrate being right
- We ship research insights, not research reports

The best research is the kind that changes what you do next.
