# Problem Validation Sprint: `[Problem Area]`

**Purpose:** To determine if a perceived problem is real, acute, and worth solving for a specific customer segment.  
**Sprint Duration:** `[Typically 3-5 days]`  
**Owner:** `[Name]`  
**Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`

> üéØ **Goal:** Get evidence fast. Don't build anything until you validate the problem exists.

---

## 1. Problem Hypothesis

*State the problem as an assumption to be tested, not a fact.*

**We believe that** `[User segment]`  
**Struggles with** `[the problem]`  
**When** `[the context/trigger]`  
**Because** `[the root cause]`

*Example: We believe that **new remote workers** struggle with **maintaining work-life balance** when **working from home** because **they lack structured boundaries between personal and professional time**.*

**Riskiest Assumption:** *Example: That this problem is painful enough for users to change their behavior and pay for a solution*

---

## 2. Problem Validation Criteria

*What's the minimum evidence needed to proceed? Be specific and measurable.*

### ‚úÖ We will consider this problem VALIDATED if:
- [ ] **Criterion 1:** *Example: At least 7 out of 10 interviewees rank this as a top-3 daily frustration*
- [ ] **AND Criterion 2:** *Example: At least 5 show us a workaround they currently use (proves they're trying to solve it)*
- [ ] **AND Criterion 3:** *Example: At least 3 say they would pay $X/month for a solution*

### ‚ùå We will KILL this problem hypothesis if:
- *Example: Less than 3 out of 10 people recognize this as a problem*
- *Example: People say "it would be nice" but show no urgency*
- *Example: Existing free solutions already solve it adequately*

---

## 3. Validation Sprint Plan

*What will we do THIS WEEK to validate? Focus on speed.*

### Day 1-2: Quick Research
- [ ] Review 20 Reddit/forum posts about `[topic]` 
- [ ] Analyze 50 tweets mentioning `[problem keywords]`
- [ ] Check if competitors are solving this (quick scan)
- [ ] Document initial findings

### Day 3-4: Customer Conversations  
- [ ] Interview 5-10 target users (30 min each)
- [ ] Use "Problem Interview Script" (see below)
- [ ] Look for emotional reactions, not just logical agreement
- [ ] Document actual quotes, not summaries

### Day 5: Synthesis & Decision
- [ ] Compile evidence against validation criteria
- [ ] Make GO/NO-GO decision
- [ ] If GO: Create first solution hypothesis
- [ ] If NO-GO: Document learnings and pick next problem

## 4. Problem Interview Script

*Keep it conversational. We're learning, not selling.*

### Opening (2 min)
"Thanks for your time. I'm researching challenges that [user segment] face with [broad topic]. There are no right/wrong answers - I just want to understand your experience."

### Problem Discovery (15 min)
1. **Context:** "Tell me about your typical day when it comes to [area]?"
2. **Problem Ranking:** "What are your top 3 frustrations with [area]?"
3. **Pain Level:** "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is [specific problem]?"
4. **Frequency:** "How often does this happen?"
5. **Current Solution:** "How do you handle this today?" *(Look for workarounds)*
6. **Consequence Test:** "What happens if you just ignore this problem and do nothing?" *(Listen for real consequences vs. minor annoyance)*
7. **Cost of Problem:** "What does this problem cost you in terms of time/money/stress?"

### Solution Validation (10 min)
8. **Magic Wand:** "If you had a magic wand, how would you solve this?"
9. **Willingness to Pay:** "Would you pay $X/month to never have this problem again?"
10. **Urgency:** "When would you need this solution? Today? This year? Someday?"

### Wrap-up (3 min)
11. **Referrals:** "Who else do you know who struggles with this?"
12. **Follow-up:** "Can I show you what we build and get your feedback?"

## 5. Evidence Collection

*Fill this out during the sprint. Real data only - no assumptions.*

### üìä Quantitative Evidence
| Metric | Target | Actual | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| *% who rank as top-3 problem* | *>70%* | *[Actual]%* | *Interviews* |
| *Average pain score (1-10)* | *>7* | *[Score]* | *Interviews* |
| *% currently using workaround* | *>50%* | *[Actual]%* | *Observation* |
| *% willing to pay* | *>30%* | *[Actual]%* | *Interviews* |

### üí¨ Qualitative Evidence
**Powerful Quotes:**
- *"[Actual quote showing pain]" - Interviewee #1*
- *"[Actual quote about current solution]" - Interviewee #3*
- *"[Actual quote about urgency]" - Interviewee #5*

**Observed Workarounds:**
- *Example: 3 people showed me complex spreadsheets they built*
- *Example: 2 people pay for multiple tools to piece together a solution*

**Surprising Insights:**
- *Example: The problem is worse on Mondays (5/5 mentioned this)*
- *Example: It's not about the tool, it's about accountability*

---

## 6. Validation Results

*Complete after sprint. Be brutally honest.*

### Verdict: ‚è≥ PENDING / ‚úÖ VALIDATED / ‚ùå INVALIDATED

### Evidence Summary
**What confirmed our hypothesis:**
- *Example: 8/10 ranked this as their #1 daily frustration*
- *Example: Average pain score was 8.5/10*
- *Example: All 10 showed us their current workarounds*

**What surprised us:**
- *Example: The problem is 10x worse for parents working from home*
- *Example: People care more about X than we thought*

**What invalidated our assumptions:**
- *Example: Only 2/10 willing to pay (expected 5/10)*
- *Example: Existing solution Y handles 80% of the need*

## 7. Next Steps

### If VALIDATED ‚úÖ
**New Solution Hypothesis to Test:**
- **We believe that** `[specific solution]`
- **For** `[validated segment]`
- **Will achieve** `[measurable outcome]`
- **We will know this is true when** `[success metric]`

**Immediate Actions:**
1. [ ] Add solution hypothesis to `hypothesis-list.md`
2. [ ] Create landing page test (24 hours)
3. [ ] Build paper prototype (48 hours)
4. [ ] **Housekeeping:** Update `lean-canvas.md` problem section with validated insights
5. [ ] **Housekeeping:** Update `opportunity-landscape.md` if market understanding changed

### If INVALIDATED ‚ùå
**Key Learning:** *What did we learn about the market/users?*

**Pivot Direction:** 
- Option A: Test adjacent problem `[New problem]`
- Option B: Test different segment `[New segment]`
- Option C: Move to completely different opportunity from `opportunity-landscape.md`

**Immediate Actions:**
1. [ ] **Housekeeping:** Document invalidated problem in `hypothesis-list.md` Learning Library
2. [ ] Pick next problem from `opportunity-landscape.md`
3. [ ] Start new validation sprint
4. [ ] **Housekeeping:** Update `lean-canvas.md` assumptions section

## 8. Time & Cost Tracking

*How much did this validation cost us?*

- **Time Invested:** [Hours]
- **Money Spent:** $[Amount] *(ads, incentives, tools)*
- **Opportunity Cost:** *What we didn't do while running this sprint*

**ROI Assessment:** *Was this sprint worth it?*
- ‚úÖ Saved us from building the wrong thing
- ‚úÖ Gave us clear direction for next steps
- ‚úÖ Generated [#] new insights about our market
