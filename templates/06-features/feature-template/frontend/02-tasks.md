## Experiment Context
>
> **Connecting the "Why" to the "How" - Keep the hypothesis front and center**

**Hypothesis Being Tested:** *[Copy from requirements.md - e.g., "We believe that users will adopt the new dashboard because it reduces report generation time"]*  
**Primary Success Metric:** *[Copy from requirements.md - e.g., "20% increase in weekly active users for the reporting feature"]*  
**Riskiest Assumption:** *[Copy from requirements.md - e.g., "Users find the current reporting flow too slow"]*  
**Failure Criteria:** *[When do we kill this experiment - e.g., "Less than 5% user adoption after 2 weeks"]*

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup

*Getting the experiment infrastructure ready*

- [ ] **[FE-001]** Set up feature flag integration *(2 points)*
  - **Requirement:** REQ-001 (Experiment Design)
  - **Design:** Frontend Design 2.1 (Feature Flags)
  - Connect to feature flag service and implement toggle UI for internal testing

- [ ] **[FE-002]** Create base component structure *(3 points)*
  - **Requirement:** REQ-002 (Functional Requirements)
  - **Design:** Frontend Design 2.2 (Component Architecture)
  - Set up component hierarchy and TypeScript interfaces for the experiment

### Phase 2: Core Experiment Implementation

*Building the minimum viable experiment to test our hypothesis*

- [ ] **[FE-003]** Implement core user flow *(5 points)*
  - **Requirement:** REQ-003 (Primary User Journey)
  - **Design:** Frontend Design 2.3 (User Experience)
  - Build the primary user interaction that tests our riskiest assumption

- [ ] **[FE-004]** Add analytics instrumentation *(2 points)*
  - **Requirement:** REQ-001 (Success Metrics)
  - **Design:** Frontend Design 2.4 (Analytics)
  - Track user interactions and conversion funnel events for hypothesis validation

### Phase 3: Production Readiness

*Making the experiment robust enough for real users*

- [ ] **[FE-005]** Add error handling and recovery *(3 points)*
  - **Requirement:** REQ-004 (Non-functional Requirements)
  - **Design:** Frontend Design 2.5 (Error Handling)
  - Implement error boundaries and user-friendly error messages

- [ ] **[FE-006]** Implement loading states *(2 points)*
  - **Requirement:** REQ-004 (Performance Requirements)
  - **Design:** Frontend Design 2.6 (Loading States)
  - Add skeleton screens and loading indicators to prevent UI jank

### Phase 4: Optimization (If Experiment Succeeds)

*Polish and optimize based on initial learnings*

- [ ] **[FE-007]** Polish animations and transitions *(2 points)*
  - **Requirement:** REQ-005 (User Experience Enhancement)
  - **Design:** Frontend Design 2.7 (Animations)
  - Add micro-interactions based on user feedback from experiment

- [ ] **[FE-008]** Optimize bundle size *(3 points)*
  - **Requirement:** REQ-004 (Performance Budget)
  - **Design:** Frontend Design 2.8 (Performance)
  - Code split and lazy load components if experiment validates

## Technical Decisions Log

*Decisions made during implementation*

| Decision | Choice | Rationale | Date |
|----------|--------|-----------|------|
| *[e.g., State management approach]* | *[e.g., Local state with Context]* | *[e.g., Simple requirements, no need for Redux]* | *[Date]* |
| *[e.g., Data fetching library]* | *[e.g., React Query]* | *[e.g., Built-in caching and retry logic]* | *[Date]* |

## Dependencies & Blockers

### Waiting On

- [ ] **Backend:** API endpoint `/api/v1/[feature]` deployed to staging
- [ ] **Design:** Final Figma designs for error states
- [ ] **Product:** Clarification on *[specific requirement]*

### Blocking Others

- **QA:** Test plan requires component completion by *[date]*
- **Backend:** API integration testing needs frontend by *[date]*

## Risk Register

*What could derail these tasks?*

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| *[e.g., Third-party library breaking change]* | Medium | High | *[Pin versions, test in staging first]* |
| *[e.g., Browser compatibility issues]* | Low | Medium | *[Early testing in all browsers]* |
| *[e.g., Performance regression]* | Medium | High | *[Performance budget alerts]* |

## Our Philosophy
>
> *"The goal is not to be right; it's to get less wrong, faster."*

- **Ship small, ship often:** Each task should be deployable independently
- **Make it work, make it right, make it fast:** In that order
- **Leave it better than you found it:** Refactor as you go
