# Wireframes

**Purpose:** This document provides minimal visual mockups focused solely on validating the core hypothesis from our PRD through the user journey defined in our user flows.

## Design Hypothesis

### What We're Testing
*How do these wireframes validate our core assumption from `prd.md`?*

- **Core Assumption:** [Restate the primary hypothesis being tested]
- **Design Hypothesis:** [How the visual design supports the core assumption]
- **Key Interaction:** [The specific UI element/interaction that proves/disproves our hypothesis]

*Example: "A single, prominent 'Start Trial' button will increase conversion by removing choice paralysis from multiple pricing options"*

## Screen Wireframes

### Screen 1: [Screen Name]
*Brief description of this screen's role in testing the hypothesis*

**Purpose:** [What this screen accomplishes in the user flow from `user-flows.md`]

**Key Elements:**
- **Primary CTA:** [Main action button/link and its purpose]
- **Supporting Content:** [Essential information displayed]
- **Navigation:** [How users get here and where they go next]

|                                  |
| [Error/success messaging area]   |
+----------------------------------+
```

**Validation Focus:**
- **Success Metric:** [How we'll measure if this screen works]
- **Risk Area:** [What might confuse or block users here]

### Screen 3: [Success/Completion Screen]
*The final screen that indicates successful hypothesis validation*

**Purpose:** [What this screen accomplishes in the user flow from `user-flows.md`]

**Key Elements:**
- **Success Confirmation:** [How we show the user succeeded]
- **Next Steps:** [What options we provide post-success]
- **Measurement Trigger:** [What indicates our hypothesis was validated]

**Wireframe Sketch:**
```
[ASCII wireframe or description]  
+----------------------------------+
| [Success indicator/checkmark]    |
+----------------------------------+
| [Confirmation message]           |
|                                  |
| [Value delivered/next steps]     |
|                                  |
| [Continue/Get started button]    |
|                                  |
| [Optional: secondary actions]    |
+----------------------------------+
```

**Validation Focus:**
- **Success Metric:** [How we'll measure if this screen works]
- **Hypothesis Confirmation:** [How reaching this screen validates our core assumption]

## Interaction Design

### Critical User Interactions
*The key interactions that make or break our hypothesis*

**Primary Interaction:** [Most important user action]
- **Trigger:** [What prompts this interaction]
- **Expected Behavior:** [How users should interact]
- **Success Indicator:** [How we know it worked]
- **Failure Recovery:** [What happens if it doesn't work]

**Secondary Interactions:** [Supporting user actions]
- **Navigation:** [How users move between screens]
- **Error Handling:** [How we help users recover from mistakes]
- **Feedback:** [How we confirm user actions]

### Mobile Considerations
*Key differences for mobile experience (if applicable)*
- **Screen Adaptation:** [How key screens change on mobile]
- **Touch Interactions:** [Mobile-specific interaction patterns]
- **Priority Changes:** [What becomes more/less important on mobile]

- [New Component 2] - [Why it's necessary for the experiment]

### Content Requirements
*Copy and content needed to support the experiment*

**Copy Priorities:**
1. **Primary CTA Text:** [Exact button/link text]
2. **Key Value Propositions:** [Essential messages to convey]
3. **Error/Success Messages:** [Critical user feedback copy]

**Content Constraints:**
- **Character Limits:** [Any technical limitations]
- **Tone Requirements:** [Brand voice considerations]
- **Localization:** [Multi-language considerations if applicable]

## Validation Plan

### User Testing Focus
*What specific design elements need validation?*

**Usability Questions:**
- [Question about visual hierarchy/clarity]
- [Question about user understanding]
- [Question about interaction effectiveness]

**A/B Testing Opportunities:**
- **Variation 1:** [Alternative design approach]
- **Variation 2:** [Another alternative design approach]
- **Test Duration:** [How long to run experiments]

### Success Metrics
