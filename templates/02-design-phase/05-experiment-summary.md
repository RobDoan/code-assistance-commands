## 3. Verdict & Learning

### Hypothesis Verdict

**[ ] Validated / [ ] Invalidated / [ ] Inconclusive**

### The Core Learning

**What is the single most important thing we learned about our customers or our solution?**

> *Example: We learned that our most active users not only have a strong intent to pay for advanced reporting, but they perceive the value to be high enough to act immediately.*

> *Example: We learned that while the problem of data export is real, our proposed "integration" solution does not align with our customers' workflow, and they are unwilling to try it.*

* **Next Action:** [What is the immediate next step? Assign an owner.]
  * [e.g., "Create epics and stories for the V1 Pro Plan." - Owner: @ProductManager]
  * [e.g., "Schedule 5 new customer interviews to explore alternative solutions for data export." - Owner: @ProductManager]
