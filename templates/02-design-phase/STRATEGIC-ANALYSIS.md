# Deep Systems Analysis: Design Phase Templates

## 1. Strategic Assessment

### Fundamental Job-to-be-Done

**The core JTBD for this template system is:** *To create the minimal shared understanding necessary to run a falsifiable experiment that generates institutional learning.*

**Current System Performance:** 7/10
The templates achieve lean documentation but miss critical psychological and organizational dynamics.

### Single Biggest Failure Mode

**The Confirmation Bias Cascade**: The templates assume rational actors but don't defend against the most common failure patternâ€”teams unconsciously designing experiments to confirm what they already believe. The system lacks "circuit breakers" to stop motivated reasoning from corrupting the entire process.

### Systemic Risks

1. **The Sunk Cost Amplifier**: Once teams fill out all 5 templates, psychological ownership makes it nearly impossible to kill bad ideas
2. **The Handoff Illusion**: Templates create false confidence that communication has occurred when critical context remains unshared
3. **The Metric Theater**: Teams optimize for filling templates rather than learning velocity
4. **The Zombie Experiment**: Experiments that should pivot continue because templates don't force hard stops

### Hidden Opportunities

1. **Pre-mortem Thinking**: Templates could force teams to predict failure modes upfront
2. **Learning Velocity Metrics**: Templates could track time-to-learning, not just outcomes
3. **Assumption Genealogy**: Templates could link assumptions to their evidence sources

## 2. Deep-Dive Analysis

### Multi-Persona Stress Test Results

#### Persona A: The Passionate Designer

**Current Template Vulnerability:**

- Can hide extensive design work inside "prototype spec"
- No mechanism to prevent over-polishing
- ASCII art constraint is easily bypassed with "See Figma link"

**Behavioral Prediction:** Will create beautiful, high-fidelity designs offline, then retrofit them into the template structure. The experiment becomes about validating their design rather than testing an assumption.

#### Persona B: The Pragmatic Engineer

**Current Template Vulnerability:**

- Tech feasibility comes too late (document #4)
- No early technical spike requirement
- Missing edge case documentation

**Behavioral Prediction:** Will discover blocking technical constraints after design is "approved," creating rework and frustration. Will build defensive abstractions "just in case" the experiment succeeds.

#### Persona C: The Biased Founder/PM

**Current Template Vulnerability:**

- Can frame hypothesis to guarantee success
- No requirement for "kill criteria"
- Success metrics can be gamed post-hoc

**Behavioral Prediction:** Will write hypothesis as "Users want X" rather than "Users will do Y." Will interpret any positive signal as validation. Will pivot the success metric after seeing initial data.

### Cognitive Bias Analysis

#### Biases AMPLIFIED by Current Templates

1. **Confirmation Bias**: No requirement to define what would DISPROVE the hypothesis
2. **Planning Fallacy**: No historical velocity data to ground estimates
3. **Anchoring Bias**: First solution proposed becomes the only solution explored
4. **Availability Heuristic**: Recent customer feedback weighted too heavily
5. **Narrative Fallacy**: Post-hoc stories explain away failed experiments

#### Biases MITIGATED by Current Templates

1. **Scope Creep**: "Explicitly NOT Building" section works well
2. **Feature-itis**: Focus on single assumption is effective
3. **Analysis Paralysis**: Time-boxed feasibility check prevents overthinking

### Second-Order Effects

#### On Code Quality

- **Current Reality**: "Temporary" experiment code becomes permanent because it "works"
- **Missing Safeguard**: No explicit "expiration date" for experiment code
- **Result**: Technical debt disguised as "MVP features"

#### On Team Dynamics

- **Current Reality**: Templates become weapons in political battles ("But the template says...")
- **Missing Element**: No retrospective process to improve the templates themselves
- **Result**: Process calcification and learned helplessness

#### On Learning Culture

- **Current Reality**: Failed experiments feel like failed projects
- **Missing Frame**: No celebration of "successful failures" that invalidate bad ideas quickly
- **Result**: Risk aversion and hypothesis padding
