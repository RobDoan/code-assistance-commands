# Strategic Recommendations: Design Phase Template System

## Executive Summary

After deep systems analysis, the current templates achieve **lean documentation** but fail at **lean thinking**. They optimize for process compliance rather than learning velocity. The revised templates (v3) introduce psychological safeguards and behavioral nudges that combat the human biases that kill experiments.

## Key Strategic Insights

### 1. The Confirmation Bias Cascade (Primary Failure Mode)

**Problem:** Teams unconsciously design experiments to confirm their beliefs rather than test them.

**Solution Applied in v3:**

- **Anti-Hypothesis Requirement**: Forces teams to define what would DISPROVE their assumption
- **Kill Criteria**: Pre-commits to stopping experiments that aren't working
- **Confidence Level Tracking**: Makes overconfidence visible before the experiment
- **Evidence Source**: Exposes when assumptions are based on thin evidence

### 2. The Sunk Cost Amplifier

**Problem:** Once teams invest time in templates, they can't kill bad ideas.

**Solution Applied in v3:**

- **14-Day Maximum**: Hard time limit prevents experiments from becoming projects
- **Effort Scoring**: Makes over-investment visible immediately
- **Failure Celebration**: Reframes failed experiments as successful learning
- **Pre-Mortem Section**: Acknowledges failure as likely and plans for it

### 3. The Zombie Code Problem

**Problem:** "Temporary" experiment code becomes permanent technical debt.

**Solution Applied in v3:**

- **Expiration Dates**: Every experiment has a removal date
- **Defensive Engineering**: Explicitly accepts brittle code for experiments
- **Time Bomb Option**: Code that self-destructs after the experiment
- **"Future You" Test**: Forces consideration of long-term regret

### 4. The Handoff Illusion

**Problem:** Templates create false confidence that communication has occurred.

**Solution Applied in v3:**

- **60-Second Gut Check**: Engineers' immediate reactions surface hidden complexity
- **Smoke and Mirrors Test**: Explicitly considers fake implementations
- **One Piece of Advice**: Human wisdom beyond the checkboxes
- **Time Spent Tracking**: Prevents over-analysis (15-min limit)

## Behavioral Design Elements

### Nudges Toward Learning

1. **"Think like a scientist, not a salesperson"** - Reframes the entire mental model
2. **Red Flags Section** - Makes anti-patterns visible and shameful
3. **Success AND Failure Celebration** - Removes stigma from invalidated hypotheses
4. **"What We WON'T Do"** - Prevents scope creep through pre-commitment

### Circuit Breakers for Bias

1. **Anti-Hypothesis** - Forces falsifiability
2. **Sample Size Requirement** - Prevents cherry-picking
3. **Inconclusive Planning** - Removes the "wait and see" escape hatch
4. **Evidence Source** - Exposes weak foundations

### Speed Accelerators

1. **XS/S/M/L Effort Scoring** - Quick visual for over-engineering
2. **"TOO BIG" Option** - Permission to reject bloated experiments
3. **Fake It Options** - Legitimizes non-code solutions
4. **3-Day Maximum** - Hard limit on engineering effort

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Cultural Preparation (Week 1)

1. Run a "Failure Party" for past failed projects—reframe them as learning victories
2. Share the "Guiding Principles" as standalone manifestos before introducing templates
3. Have leadership publicly commit to celebrating failed experiments

### Phase 2: Pilot with Champions (Weeks 2-3)

1. Select one high-trust team to pilot the v3 templates
2. Have them run one experiment with old templates, one with new
3. Measure: Time to decision, team satisfaction, learning quality

### Phase 3: Systemic Rollout (Week 4+)

1. Use pilot team as evangelists
2. Create a "Myth Busters Wall" for invalidated assumptions
3. Track and publish "Learning Velocity" metrics (experiments/month, time-to-learning)

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Leadership must model failure celebration** - First failed experiment should come from the top
2. **Enforce time limits religiously** - No exceptions for "just one more week"
3. **Make templates living documents** - Monthly retrospectives to improve them
4. **Measure learning, not features** - OKRs based on "assumptions validated/invalidated" not "features shipped"

## Metrics for Success

### Leading Indicators (Weekly)

- Number of experiments started
- Number of experiments killed before completion
- Average time from brief to decision
- Percentage with defined anti-hypothesis

### Lagging Indicators (Monthly)

- Learning velocity (validated + invalidated assumptions / month)
- Experiment code that became production (should be <20%)
- Team confidence in decision-making (survey)
- Reduction in feature development time (from better validated assumptions)

## The Meta-Learning Loop

These templates themselves should be treated as experiments:

1. **Hypothesis**: Adding psychological safeguards will increase learning velocity by 50%
2. **Anti-Hypothesis**: If teams game the new fields without changing behavior, we'll see no improvement
3. **Kill Criteria**: If 3 teams in a row find the templates too complex, we simplify
4. **Success Metric**: 10+ validated/invalidated assumptions in first month

## Final Thought

The best process is the one that makes the right thing the easy thing. These templates don't just document experiments—they shape how teams think about uncertainty. By making failure cheap, fast, and celebrated, we transform experiments from "mini-projects" into true learning instruments.

Remember: **A template system that can't evolve is already dead. These should be v3 of many versions to come.**
