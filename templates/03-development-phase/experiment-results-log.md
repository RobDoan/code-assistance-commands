# Experiment Results Log (IMPROVED - Also see experiment-debrief.md)

> **⚠️ CTO NOTE:** This template has been streamlined. For a leaner version focused on decisions over documentation, see `experiment-debrief.md`. 
> The version below reduces ceremony and emphasizes learning over reporting.

**Purpose:** This document tracks the performance data and learnings from our experiment to make evidence-based decisions about whether to pivot, persevere, or kill the feature.

## Experiment Overview

### Hypothesis
**Original Hypothesis:** *We believe that [target users] will [take specific action] because [underlying assumption about user behavior/needs].*

### Success Criteria
**Primary Metric:** *The one metric that determines success/failure*
- **Target:** *Specific, measurable goal*
- **Measurement Method:** *How we're tracking this*
- **Statistical Significance:** *Confidence level required (typically 95%)*

*Example: "20% of users who see the feedback widget will click on it, measured via analytics events, with 95% confidence."*

**Secondary Metrics:** *Supporting metrics that provide context*
- **Metric 2:** [Target] - [Measurement method]
