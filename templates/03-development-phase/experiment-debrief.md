> **Our Engineering Philosophy:** This document is for learning, not judgment. Its goal is to dispassionately evaluate a hypothesis against reality and make a smart decision. We celebrate invalidated hypotheses as much as validated ones, because both represent learning. Be honest, be data-driven, and be decisive.

# Debrief: [Feature/Experiment Name]

**Owner:** [Product Manager] | **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## 1. Hypothesis vs. Reality

- **Hypothesis:** We believed that...
- **Result:** The primary metric, `[Metric Name]`, hit `[Actual Value]` against a target of `[Target Value]`. This was a [SUCCESS/FAILURE].

## 2. Key Learning

- **What We Learned:** [The single most important insight from this experiment, including what didn't work as expected.]
- **What Surprised Us:** [The most unexpected outcome, qualitative or quantitative.]

## 3. The Decision

**[ ‚úÖ PERSEVERE / üîÅ PIVOT / ‚ùå KILL ]**

**Next Step:** [The immediate, single next action. e.g., "Roll out to 100%," or "Design new experiment to test X," or "Remove feature flag from codebase."]
