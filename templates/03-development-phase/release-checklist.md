# Release Checklist (IMPROVED - Also see pre-flight-checklist.md)

> **⚠️ CTO NOTE:** This template has been streamlined. For a leaner version focused on non-automatable checks, see `pre-flight-checklist.md`. 
> The version below removes ceremony and assumes proper CI/CD automation.

**Purpose:** This checklist ensures our experiment is shipped safely, with proper monitoring in place to measure results and quick rollback capability if needed.
