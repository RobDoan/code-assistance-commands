# Risk-Incident Synchronization Script

## Purpose
Creates a closed-loop system between risk predictions and actual incidents, ensuring the Risk Register evolves based on real-world events and improving risk assessment accuracy over time.

## Functionality
This script integrates with the incident response process to:

1. **Monitor Rollbacks**: Detects when a rollback is triggered from `release-runbook.md`
2. **Capture Incident Data**: Collects information about the incident:
   - Timestamp and duration
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Recovery actions taken
3. **Cross-Reference Risk Register**: Checks if the incident was a predicted risk:
   - If YES: Updates risk status, validates mitigation effectiveness
   - If NO: Creates new risk entry based on incident learnings
4. **Generate Post-Incident Checklist**: Automatically creates mandatory review items:
   - Was this risk documented?
   - Did mitigations work as expected?
   - What new risks were exposed?
5. **Update Documentation**: Modifies `risk-register.md` with findings

## Trigger Conditions
- Automatically triggered on production rollback
- Runs after incident resolution
- Manual trigger for near-miss events
- Weekly reconciliation check

## Input
- Incident report data (from monitoring/alerting systems)
- Current risk-register.md
- Rollback logs from release-runbook execution

## Output
- Updated risk-register.md with incident correlation
- Post-incident review template with pre-filled data
- Risk prediction accuracy metrics
- Notification to risk owners

## Configuration
```yaml
# config.yaml
risk_register_path: "./learning/risk-register.md"
incident_sources:
  - pagerduty
  - rollback_logs
  - monitoring_alerts
auto_create_risks: true
risk_threshold_for_escalation: "high"
review_deadline_days: 3
```

## Benefits
- Validates risk predictions against reality
- Prevents "unknown unknowns" from remaining unknown
- Improves risk assessment accuracy over time
- Creates accountability for risk mitigation strategies

## Implementation Notes
- Must handle both automated and manual incident reports
- Should preserve risk history (don't delete, mark as "Realized")
- Integrates with existing incident management tools
- Maintains risk ownership assignments

## Integration Points
- Release runbook rollback procedures
- Incident management systems (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, etc.)
- Monitoring and alerting platforms
- Team notification channels

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning to predict risk probability based on patterns
- Automatic risk score adjustment based on incident frequency
- Correlation analysis between multiple risks
- Predictive alerts when risk indicators exceed thresholds
