# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

> **Template for Architecture Decision Records**
>
> Copy this template for each significant architectural decision.

## Our Philosophy

We capture the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what." Every technical choice is a hypothesis about what will work best. When context changes, we revisit decisions with new ADRs rather than editing old ones.

**Principle:** "Future us will thank current us for explaining our reasoning."
