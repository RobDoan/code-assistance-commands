# Learning Library: Our Invalidated Assumptions

> **The graveyard of bad ideas that saved us millions.**
>
> Every funeral here represents time, money, and effort not wasted.

## Our Philosophy

An invalidated hypothesis is not a failure—it's a victory. This library captures our most valuable learnings: the assumptions we proved wrong before they could hurt us. We celebrate these deaths because they make us smarter.

**Motto:** "We fail fast, learn faster, and remember longest."

## How to Use This Library

- **Before starting a new experiment:** Search this library for related invalidated assumptions
- **Link from your experiment brief:** Reference relevant learnings in new `experiment-brief.md` files
- **During retrospectives:** Review recent funerals to extract patterns
- **For onboarding:** New team members should read the Hall of Fame to quickly learn what doesn't work
- **For competitive advantage:** During quarterly planning, ask "What did we learn that lets us take smart risks our competitors wouldn't?"

## 🏆 Funeral Hall of Fame

*Our biggest saves—hypotheses that could have cost us months or years*

### 💀 [Date] The Great [Feature Name] Funeral

**Deceased Hypothesis:** "[What we believed]"

**Cause of Death:** "[What data/insight killed it]"

**Estimated Save:** [Time/Money/Resources not wasted]

**Memorial Quote:** "[Key learning in one sentence]"

**Mourners:** [Team members involved]

**Flowers:** [Recognition/celebration done]

**Legacy:** [How this changed our approach going forward]

## 🔄 Learning Patterns

### Recurring Themes

*What assumptions do we keep making incorrectly?*

- **Pattern 1:** [e.g., "We consistently overestimate user engagement with new features"]
- **Pattern 2:** [e.g., "We underestimate technical complexity of third-party integrations"]  
- **Pattern 3:** [e.g., "We assume users want more options when they want fewer"]

### Early Warning Signs

*How to spot similar assumptions before they become experiments*

- 🚩 **Red Flag 1:** [Signal that suggests similar assumption might be wrong]
- 🚩 **Red Flag 2:** [Signal that suggests similar assumption might be wrong]
- 🚩 **Red Flag 3:** [Signal that suggests similar assumption might be wrong]

## 🔗 Learning Connections

### How Our Learnings Connect

*Map relationships between invalidated assumptions*

```
User Need A (invalidated) ←→ User Need B (validated)
     ↓
Technical Approach C (invalidated) → Technical Approach D (validated)
     ↓  
Business Model E (testing)
```

### Cross-Pollination Opportunities

*Where learnings from one area might apply to another*

- **Learning from [Area A]** could apply to **[Area B]** because **[reasoning]**
- **Learning from [Area C]** could apply to **[Area D]** because **[reasoning]**

### Competitive Intelligence

*How our failure library becomes strategic advantage*

**Quarterly Review Question:** "What did we learn from the library last quarter that will allow us to take a smart risk our competitors wouldn't?"

Examples:

- **We learned [X] doesn't work** → **So we can focus resources on [Y] while competitors waste time on [X]**
- **We discovered [Z] pattern fails** → **So we can avoid similar pitfalls that will trip up others**
- **We validated [W] approach** → **So we can double down while others are still experimenting**
