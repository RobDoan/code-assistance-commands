# Architecture Overview: The System Map

> **The narrative that connects all our decisions.**  
>
> This is the only architectural document that tells a story, not just logs decisions.

## Our Philosophy

While ADRs capture the "why" of individual decisions, this overview provides the "how it all fits together" narrative. New team members start here to form a coherent mental model before diving into the detailed decision log.

**Principle:** "A map, not an archaeological dig."

## System Context (C4 Level 1)

*[Insert C4 System Context diagram here]*

### What We Do

[Brief description of the system's primary purpose and value proposition]

### Who Uses Us

- **[Primary User Type]:** [What they do with the system]
- **[Secondary User Type]:** [What they do with the system]
- **[Admin User Type]:** [What they do with the system]

### What We Connect To

- **[External System 1]:** [What data/services we exchange]
- **[External System 2]:** [What data/services we exchange]
- **[External System 3]:** [What data/services we exchange]

## Container Architecture (C4 Level 2)

*[Insert C4 Container diagram here]*

### The Big Picture

Our system consists of [X] main containers that work together:

#### üåê **[Frontend Container Name]**

**Technology:** [Framework/Language]  
**Purpose:** [What this container does]  
**Key Decisions:** [Link to relevant ADRs]

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **[Backend API Container Name]**

**Technology:** [Framework/Language]  
**Purpose:** [What this container does]  
**Key Decisions:** [Link to relevant ADRs]

#### üóÑÔ∏è **[Database Container Name]**

**Technology:** [Database system]  
**Purpose:** [What this container stores]  
**Key Decisions:** [Link to relevant ADRs]

#### üîÑ **[Message Queue/Background Jobs Container Name]** *(if applicable)*

**Technology:** [Queue system]  
**Purpose:** [What this container processes]  
**Key Decisions:** [Link to relevant ADRs]

## Data Flow & Communication

### Request Flow

```
User Request ‚Üí [Frontend] ‚Üí [API Gateway] ‚Üí [Backend Services] ‚Üí [Database]
                  ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì
              [Caching]    [Authentication]  [Background Jobs]
```

### Key Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous:** [When we use sync communication and why]
- **Asynchronous:** [When we use async communication and why]
- **Data Consistency:** [How we handle consistency across containers]

## Critical Architecture Decisions

*These are the 5-7 most important architectural choices that shape our system:*

### 1. [Major Decision 1]

**ADR:** [Link to ADR-XXX]  
**Impact:** [How this affects the whole system]  
**Trade-offs:** [What we gained vs. what we gave up]

### 2. [Major Decision 2]

**ADR:** [Link to ADR-XXX]  
**Impact:** [How this affects the whole system]  
**Trade-offs:** [What we gained vs. what we gave up]

### 3. [Major Decision 3]

**ADR:** [Link to ADR-XXX]  
**Impact:** [How this affects the whole system]  
**Trade-offs:** [What we gained vs. what we gave up]

## Maintenance Notes

### Last Updated

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**By:** [Team/Person who updated]  
**Changes:** [What was updated and why]

### Quarterly Review Schedule

This document is reviewed and updated every quarter during planning:
