# Tech Stack: Strategic Technology Choices

> **Every technology is a bet on the future.**  
>
> This isn't just a list‚Äîit's our strategic technology decisions with the reasoning behind each choice.

## Our Philosophy

Technology choices are hypotheses about what will help us learn and build faster. We choose boring, proven technology when possible, and bleeding-edge only when the learning advantage is significant.

**Principle:** "We optimize for team velocity and learning speed, not technical elegance."
