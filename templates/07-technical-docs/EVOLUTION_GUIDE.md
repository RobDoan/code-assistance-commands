# Documentation Evolution Guide

> **This system is designed to evolve, not calcify.**
>
> Templates should get simpler over time, not more complex. Documents should die when they stop being useful.

## Evolution Philosophy

Documentation is a living experiment. These templates are hypotheses about what information helps us learn and build faster. When reality disproves a template, we change it. When a document stops being used, we delete it.

**Core Principle:** "The best documentation system is the one that gets out of the way."

## 🔄 Continuous Evolution Cycle

```
Usage Data → Pain Points → Hypothesis → Template Changes → Validation
    ↑                                                        ↓
    ←─────────── Learning & Feedback ←────────────────────────
```

### Monthly Evolution Sprints (Last Friday of each month)

**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Participants:** Whole team  
**Outcome:** 1-3 template improvements or eliminations

## 📊 Evolution Metrics

### Template Health Dashboard

| Template | Usage Frequency | Completion Rate | User Satisfaction | Evolution Status |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **experiment-brief.md** | [X]/week | [Y]% | [Z]/5 | 🟢 Healthy |
| **learning-library.md** | [X]/week | [Y]% | [Z]/5 | 🟡 Needs tweaks |
| **release-runbook.md** | [X]/week | [Y]% | [Z]/5 | 🔴 Needs major changes |

### Success Indicators

- **High Usage + High Satisfaction** = Template is working well
- **High Usage + Low Satisfaction** = Template needs improvement  
- **Low Usage + High Satisfaction** = Template might be too narrow/specific
- **Low Usage + Low Satisfaction** = Template should be killed/merged

## 🎯 Evolution Triggers

### When to Evolve a Template

#### Immediate Evolution (Fix within 1 week)

- **Confusion signals:** Multiple people ask for clarification
- **Abandonment signals:** Started documents left incomplete >50% of time
- **Inefficiency signals:** Template takes significantly longer than estimated

#### Planned Evolution (Next monthly sprint)

- **Redundancy signals:** Information appears in multiple templates
- **Complexity signals:** Template has >10 sections or >2 pages
- **Staleness signals:** Template hasn't been updated in 6+ months

#### Consider Retirement (Evaluate for deletion)

- **Usage signals:** <1 use per month for 3 consecutive months
- **Value signals:** Team can't identify specific benefits
- **Replacement signals:** Another template or tool does this job better

## 🧪 Template Experimentation Framework

### How to Test Template Changes

#### Small Experiments (A/B test approach)

1. **Create variant** of existing template with proposed changes
2. **Split usage** - half the team uses old, half uses new version
3. **Measure outcomes** - completion rates, satisfaction, time spent  
4. **Decide based on data** after 2-4 weeks

#### Large Experiments (New template creation)

1. **Start with hypothesis** - "We believe [new template] will help [specific team need]"
2. **Create MVP version** - minimal sections, basic structure
3. **Test with volunteers** - 2-3 team members try it first
4. **Iterate quickly** based on early feedback
5. **Graduate or kill** after 4-6 weeks

## 🏗️ Template Evolution Patterns

### Simplification Patterns (Things that typically get removed)

#### Administrative Overhead

- **Metadata that nobody references** (authors, reviewers, approval dates)
- **Status tracking that doesn't drive decisions** (percentage complete fields)
- **Mandatory fields that add no value** (generic description fields)

#### Analysis Paralysis Triggers

- **Too many options in single templates** (>5 choices overwhelm)
- **Perfectionist guidance** ("comprehensive analysis required")
- **Over-specification** (exact formatting requirements vs. content quality)

### Power-Up Patterns (Things that typically get added)

#### Automation Hooks

- **Copy-paste code blocks** instead of abstract instructions
- **Template variables** that auto-populate common fields
- **Links to related templates** that create workflow connections

#### Learning Acceleration

- **Example sections** showing what good looks like
- **Anti-pattern warnings** showing what to avoid
- **Success criteria** that make outcomes measurable

## 🔗 Interconnection Evolution

### How Templates Should Connect

#### Current Connection Map

```
Experiment Brief ──→ Learning Library ──→ Next Experiment
       ↓                    ↓                   ↓
   Tech Stack      Risk Register         ADR Template
       ↓                    ↓                   ↓
Release Runbook ──→ Development Workflow ──→ Testing Manifesto
```

#### Evolution Opportunities

- **Missing connections:** Where do teams get stuck between templates?
- **Redundant connections:** Where do templates duplicate information?
- **Workflow gaps:** What happens between template stages?

### Workflow Integration Goals

- **Seamless handoffs:** Output of one template becomes input to another
- **Consistent language:** Same terms and concepts across all templates
- **Progressive disclosure:** More detail available when needed, hidden when not

## 🔧 Evolution Toolkit

### Evolution Review Questions

*Ask these during monthly evolution sprints*

**For each template:**

1. **Usage:** Who used this? How often? What for?
2. **Value:** What decisions did this template inform?
3. **Pain Points:** Where did people get stuck or confused?
4. **Connections:** How did this link to other templates or processes?
5. **Evolution:** What would make this 10% better?

### Template Health Checkup

- 🚩 **Workarounds:** People creating informal alternatives
- 🚩 **Staleness:** Template unchanged for >6 months despite usage
- 🚩 **Complexity:** Template takes >2x longer to complete than similar templates

## 🎉 Evolution Celebration

### When Templates Evolve Successfully

- **Share the story** of what problem was solved
- **Thank contributors** who suggested improvements
- **Document the learning** for future template design
- **Celebrate simplicity** when templates get shorter/clearer

### When Templates Die  

- **Celebrate the funeral** - template served its purpose
- **Archive with honor** - preserve for future reference
- **Extract the learnings** - what made this template obsolete?
- **Clean up connections** - remove links from other templates

## 🔮 Evolution Guiding Principle

**Our documentation should become more automated and less visible over time.**

This single principle guides all our evolution decisions. Templates should fade into the background as they become more effective, automating capture and synthesis of learning while requiring less conscious effort from the team.

*"The best template is the one you don't notice you're using."*
