- **Dependencies:** `Task 2.1`
- **Estimate:** `[To Be Estimated]`
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [x] Sample application is created under `./app/apps/sample-app/`.
  - [x] Application successfully imports and uses code from the shared library.
  - [x] Application can be built and run using Nx commands.
- **Key Technical Steps:**
  - [x] Generate a Node.js application using `nx generate @nx/node:application apps/sample-app --bundler=esbuild`.
  - [x] Import and use functions from the shared library in the sample app.
  - [x] Configure TypeScript imports and ensure proper dependency resolution.

## 4. Phase 3: Build System and Validation

### **Task 3.1: Configure Vite as Default Bundler**

- **Description:** Configure the workspace to use Vite as the default bundler for all applications and buildable libraries.
- **Traceability (Requirements):** `NFR-03: Performance`
- **Dependencies:** `Task 2.2`
- **Estimate:** `[To Be Estimated]`
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [x] Vite is installed and configured at the workspace level.
  - [x] Default bundler configuration is set to Vite in workspace settings.
  - [x] Sample application uses appropriate bundler (esbuild for Node.js) and library uses Vite.
  - [x] Vite build and serve commands work correctly.
- **Key Technical Steps:**
  - [x] Install Vite dependencies using `npm install --save-dev @nx/vite vite`.
  - [x] Update nx.json to set Vite as the default bundler for new projects.
  - [x] Configure vite.config.ts files for the workspace.
  - [x] Verify Vite integration with `nx build shared`.

### **Task 3.2: Configure ESLint for Project**

- **Description:** Set up ESLint configuration across the monorepo to ensure consistent code quality and maintainability.
