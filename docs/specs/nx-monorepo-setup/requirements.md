# Requirements: Nx Monorepo Setup

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for setting up a new Nx monorepo to manage a collection of TypeScript-based tools. The goal is to create a centralized repository that facilitates code sharing, unified builds, and streamlined dependency management.

## 2. Stakeholders

-   **User:** Developer
-   **Role:** System Architect

## 3. Functional Requirements

| ID      | Requirement                | User Story                                                                                                                               | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------ | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR-01   | **Initialize Nx Workspace**  | As a developer, I want to initialize a new Nx workspace so that I can start building my monorepo.                                        | - A new Nx workspace is created.<br>- The workspace is configured to use `typescript`.<br>- The workspace is located in the `./app` directory.                                                 |
| FR-02   | **Monorepo Structure**     | As a developer, I want the monorepo to be located in the `./app` directory to keep the root directory clean for other project-related files. | - The Nx workspace and all its related configuration files are contained within the `./app` directory.<br>- The root directory remains available for non-application code like GitHub Actions, documentation, and DevOps scripts. |
| FR-03   | **Package Manager**        | As a developer, I want to use `npm` as the package manager for the monorepo.                                                             | - The Nx workspace is configured to use `npm`.<br>- A `package.json` file is present in the `./app` directory.                                                                      |
| FR-04   | **Code Sharing**           | As a developer, I want to be able to easily share code between different tools within the monorepo.                                      | - The Nx workspace is configured to support shared libraries.<br>- A sample shared library can be created and imported into two different application projects.                         |

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID      | Requirement       | Description                                                                                                                            |
| :------ | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NFR-01  | **Scalability**   | The monorepo structure should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of tools and libraries without significant performance degradation. |
| NFR-02  | **Maintainability** | The workspace should be easy to maintain. This includes clear dependency graphs, consistent linting rules, and a straightforward process for adding new projects. |
| NFR-03  | **Performance**   | The build and test processes should be optimized for speed, leveraging Nx's caching capabilities.                                        |

## 5. Out of Scope

-   Migration of existing tools into the new monorepo.
-   CI/CD pipeline setup for the monorepo.
-   Specific tool implementation details.
