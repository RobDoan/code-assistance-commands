# Project Config Symlinker Requirements

## 1. Overview & Business Goals
A command-line tool that creates symbolic links between project configuration files/folders and target projects, enabling developers to easily share and synchronize configuration across multiple projects while maintaining a centralized source of truth.

**Business Goal(s):** Reduce configuration duplication and improve consistency across development projects

**KPI(s):** Configuration setup time reduction, Developer productivity improvement

## 2. Scope
2.1 **In Scope:**
  1. Command-line interface for linking configurations
  2. JSON configuration file support
  3. Symbolic link creation for files and folders
  4. Target directory validation and creation
  5. Configuration file selection options
  6. User confirmation for overwrites
  7. Recursive file linking with folder structure preservation

2.2 **Out of Scope:**
  1. Configuration file validation or syntax checking
  2. Version control integration
  3. Remote project support (only local filesystem)
  4. Configuration templates or generators
  5. Undo/rollback functionality

## 3. Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run a setup command with a target project path, so that I can quickly link my configuration files to a new project.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation)

1. **WHEN** a user runs `setup-command <path_to_project>` **THE SYSTEM SHALL** validate that the target project path exists.
2. **WHEN** the target path is invalid **THE SYSTEM SHALL** display an error message and exit with non-zero status.
3. **WHEN** the command is executed successfully **THE SYSTEM SHALL** create symbolic links according to the configuration file.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to read a configuration JSON file, so that I can define which files and folders should be linked to target projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation)

1. **WHEN** no configuration file is specified **THE SYSTEM SHALL** use `setup-config.json` as the default configuration file in the current directory.
2. **WHEN** a custom configuration file is specified **THE SYSTEM SHALL** use that file instead of the default.
3. **WHEN** the configuration file doesn't exist **THE SYSTEM SHALL** display an error message indicating the missing file.
4. **WHEN** reading the configuration file **THE SYSTEM SHALL** parse JSON with properties: `original`, `target`, and `type`.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create folder symbolic links, so that I can share entire directory structures with target projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation)

1. **WHEN** the configuration type is "folder" **THE SYSTEM SHALL** create a symbolic link to the entire folder.
2. **WHEN** the target folder already exists **THE SYSTEM SHALL** prompt the user for confirmation to override.
3. **WHEN** the user confirms override **THE SYSTEM SHALL** remove the existing folder and create the symbolic link.
4. **WHEN** the user declines override **THE SYSTEM SHALL** skip that configuration entry and continue with others.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create file-level symbolic links with preserved folder structure, so that I can selectively share individual files while maintaining organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation)

1. **WHEN** the configuration type is "files" **THE SYSTEM SHALL** create symbolic links for each file in the source folder.
2. **WHEN** the target folder doesn't exist **THE SYSTEM SHALL** create the necessary directory structure.
3. **WHEN** processing subdirectories **THE SYSTEM SHALL** replicate the folder structure in the target location.
4. **WHEN** encountering subdirectories **THE SYSTEM SHALL** create symbolic links only for files, not folders.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify custom configuration files, so that I can use different setups for different project types.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation)

1. **WHEN** a `--config` option is provided **THE SYSTEM SHALL** use the specified configuration file path.
2. **WHEN** no config option is specified **THE SYSTEM SHALL** default to `setup-config.json` in the current directory.
3. **WHEN** the specified config file is not found **THE SYSTEM SHALL** display an error and exit.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want target paths to default to the same as original paths when not specified, so that I can maintain consistent folder structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation)

1. **WHEN** the target property is empty or not specified **THE SYSTEM SHALL** use the original path as the target path.
2. **WHEN** both original and target are specified **THE SYSTEM SHALL** use the target path for link creation.
3. **WHEN** resolving paths **THE SYSTEM SHALL** treat all paths as relative to their respective root directories.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance:** The system shall complete symbolic link creation for up to 100 configuration entries in under 5 seconds.
2. **Security:** The system shall validate that symbolic links do not point outside the target project directory to prevent directory traversal attacks.
3. **Usability:** The system shall provide clear error messages and confirmation prompts for all user interactions.
4. **Compatibility:** The system shall work on Unix-like systems that support symbolic links (Linux, macOS).
