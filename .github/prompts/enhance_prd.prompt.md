# Enhance Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

As an expert product manager and technical architect, your role is to thoroughly review all project documents and enhance the existing Product Requirements Documents by providing additional analysis and improvements as outlined below.

## Process
Follow these steps to enhance the Product Requirements Documents (PRDs):
1. Read the existing requirements files.
2. Analyze source documents for gaps and areas of improvement.
3. Enhance existing content without overwriting core elements.
4. Add new sections where beneficial.
5. Ensure consistency and clarity across all documents.

### For Product PRD
Read the `product-docs/02_requirements/product_requirements_document.md` file and enhance the following topics:

**User Personas:**
- Review all existing personas for completeness and relevance.
- Identify any missing user types and add new personas as needed.
- Ensure each persona includes goals, pain points, and context of use.

**User Stories & Acceptance Criteria:**
- Expand current user stories with more detail and context.
- For each story, add clear, actionable, and testable acceptance criteria.
- Ensure stories cover all major workflows and edge cases.

**User Journey Mapping:**
- Create or refine user journey maps to visualize key workflows and touchpoints.
- Highlight pain points and opportunities for improvement.
- Use diagrams or step-by-step text to illustrate user interactions.

**Feature Priority Matrix:**
- Develop a matrix categorizing features by business value, user impact, and implementation effort.
- Prioritize features to guide roadmap decisions and resource allocation.
- Clearly explain the rationale for prioritization.

### For Technology Stack
Read the `product-docs/03_design/technology-stack.md` file and enhance the following topics:

**Technical Architecture Diagrams (text/ASCII):**
- Analyze the current architecture and update diagrams in text/ASCII format.
- Clearly illustrate system components, data flow, and integration points.
- Add missing elements or clarify ambiguous areas.

**Performance Requirements and Benchmarks:**
- Review documented performance criteria and identify gaps.
- Specify measurable benchmarks for responsiveness, scalability, and resource utilization.
- Recommend improvements where current benchmarks are insufficient.

**Security Considerations:**
- Assess current security measures and highlight potential vulnerabilities.
- Recommend best practices for authentication, authorization, data protection, and compliance.
- Suggest improvements for secure development and deployment.

**Deployment and DevOps Recommendations:**
- Evaluate deployment workflows and DevOps practices.
- Suggest improvements for CI/CD pipelines, environment management, monitoring, and rollback strategies.
- Ensure recommendations align with project scale and goals.

**Testing Strategy:**
- Examine the documented testing approach for unit, integration, E2E, and performance testing.
- Propose enhancements to ensure comprehensive coverage and alignment with quality goals.
- Recommend tools and processes for effective testing.

### Additional Analysis
- **Risk Assessment:** Identify key risks, their potential impact, and mitigation strategies.
- **Success Metrics and KPIs:** Define measurable success criteria and key performance indicators for the project.
- **Competitive Differentiation:** Analyze competitors and highlight unique value propositions.
- **Technical Debt Considerations:** Assess areas of technical debt and recommend strategies for management and reduction.
