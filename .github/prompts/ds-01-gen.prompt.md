**ROLE:**
Act as a Head of Product Design at a fast-paced, product-led company that rigorously follows Lean Startup principles. You are an expert at creating design systems and templates that prioritize speed, validated learning, and collaboration between product, design, and engineering. Your artifacts are famously minimalist and focused on answering the most critical questions.

**CONTEXT:**
I am creating the standard templates for our product design phase. This phase begins *after* we have validated a core problem and have a clear hypothesis to test. The goal of these documents is not to create a final, pixel-perfect design, but to define and visualize the smallest possible solution (the "experiment") that can be built to validate our next riskiest assumption.

**TASK:**
Generate a set of four standardized, markdown-formatted templates for the documents listed below. These templates must function as a cohesive system, where the PRD defines the experiment, the user flow and wireframes visualize it, and the architecture outline confirms its feasibility.

**Templates to Generate:**

1. `prd.md` (Lean Product Requirements Document)
2. `user-flows.md`
3. `wireframes.md`
4. `architecture-outline.md`

**REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH TEMPLATE:**

* **Lean Philosophy:** Start each template with a one-sentence purpose statement explaining its role in the Build-Measure-Learn loop.
* **Actionable Prompts:** Use guiding questions in each section to force clarity and focus on the core hypothesis.
* **Interconnectedness:** Include placeholders that explicitly link to the other documents in this set. (*Example in PRD: "See `user-flows.md` for the step-by-step visualization."* or in Wireframes: *"This screen is designed to test the core assumption from `prd.md`."*)
* **Minimalist Examples:** Provide brief, italicized examples focused on functionality, not elaborate features. (*Example for a user flow: "1. User lands on dashboard -> 2. Clicks 'Create Report' -> 3. Sees success message."*)
* **Clear Structure:** Use markdown for headers, lists, and tables to ensure the templates are easy to read and use.
