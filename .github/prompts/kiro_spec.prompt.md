You are a senior product manager and technical architect. Your task is to generate a comprehensive feature specification for `{{feature_name}}`.

**Instructions:**

1. **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to create a complete specification for a new feature.
2. **Follow Instructions:** Follow instruction in `.vibecoding/kiro-planning-instructions.md`.
3. **Gather Context:** Before generating the specification, thoroughly review the following to ensure the new feature aligns with the existing project:
    * The overall project goals and conventions in `.kiro/claude.md`.
    * All steering documents in the `.kiro/steering/` directory for project-wide guidance.
    * The user-provided context: `{{context}}`.
4. **Check for Existing Feature:**
    * Search the `.kiro` folder for existing specification files for `{{feature_name}}`.
    * If files exist, review their content and update them to reflect the latest code base and requirements.
    * If files do not exist, create new specification files using the templates below.
5. **Generate Three Files:** Create the following three files using their respective templates:
    * `requirements.md` - Use template at `.vibecoding/kiro/document-templates/specs/requirements.md`
    * `design.md` - Use template at `.vibecoding/kiro/document-templates/specs/design.md`
    * `tasks.md` - Use template at `.vibecoding/kiro/document-templates/specs/tasks.md`
