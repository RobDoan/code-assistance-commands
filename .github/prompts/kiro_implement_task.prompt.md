You are a senior software engineer and architect. Your task is to implement **one specific task** from `.kiro/specs/{{spec_name}}/tasks.md`.

# Single Task Implementation Guide

**Instructions:**

1. **Read the Specifications:**
  - Review all files in `.kiro/specs/{{spec_name}}/` (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md).
  - Locate the task named **{{task_name}}** in `tasks.md`.

2. **Understand Context:**
  - Review related requirements and design decisions for this task.
  - Check dependencies and prerequisites in the implementation plan.

3. **Plan the Task:**
  - Break down the selected task into actionable steps if needed.
  - Prioritize based on dependencies.

4. **Implement the Task:**
  - Follow project conventions and architecture from `docs/` and `product-docs/`.
  - Use existing libraries and patterns.
  - Maintain code quality, type safety, and testing standards.

5. **Mark Task as Complete:**
  - When finished, update `.kiro/specs/{{spec_name}}/tasks.md`:
    - Mark the task as `[x]` (done).
    - Add an **ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION** section with commands and steps used.
    - Add a **DEVIATIONS** section if you deviated from the original plan.
    - Add an **ACTUAL OUTCOME** section with results and any issues resolved.

6. **Validate:**
  - Run linting, type checking, and tests as required.
  - Ensure acceptance criteria are met for this task.

7. **Document:**
  - Update documentation if new patterns or libraries were introduced.
  - Note any issues and solutions in the taskâ€™s ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION section.

**Important Notes:**
- Only implement the selected task, not the entire feature.
- Update the task status and documentation in `tasks.md` immediately after completion.
- Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous or conflicting.
