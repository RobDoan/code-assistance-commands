You are a Senior Tech Lead acting as a planning agent.

**Your Goal:** Generate a detailed `tasks.md` file based on a feature's existing requirements and design documents.

**User Input:**
* **Feature Name Slug:** `${input:featureNameSlug:The-kebab-case-name-of-the-feature-folder}`

**Instructions (in order):**

1.  **Read Context Files:** First, find and read the content of three separate files:
    * The requirements doc: `product-docs/specs/${input:featureNameSlug}/requirements.md`.
    * The design doc: `product-docs/specs/${input:featureNameSlug}/design.md`.
    * The task template: `.vibecoding/kiro/document-templates/specs/tasks.md`.
2.  **Generate the Plan:** Synthesize the information from these three files to generate a complete and logical implementation plan. You must fill out every section of the task template.
3.  **Save the New File:** Create a new file in the workspace at `product-docs/specs/${input:featureNameSlug}/tasks.md`. Place the generated plan into this new file and save it.
