You are a senior software engineer and architect. Your task is to implement code based on the comprehensive specifications found in `.kiro/specs/{{spec_name}}/`.

# Implementation Guide

**Instructions:**

1.  **Read the Specifications:** Thoroughly examine all files in `.kiro/specs/{{spec_name}}/`:
    *   `requirements.md` - User stories, acceptance criteria, and functional requirements
    *   `design.md` - Technical architecture, API specifications, and design decisions
    *   `tasks.md` - Implementation phases and detailed task breakdown

2.  **Read and Follow Design Guides:** Examine all documentation in the `docs/` and `product-docs` folders to understand the project architecture, libraries, and implementation guides:
    *   Read `docs/README.md` for service overview and quick start commands.
    *   Review `docs/architecture/service_architecture.md` for folder structure and architectural decisions.
    *   Study `docs/tech_stack/framework_choice.md` for chosen technologies and version compatibility.
    *   Follow `docs/guides/testing_guide.md` for testing patterns and best practices.
    *   Reference `product-docs/project_guides/coding_standards.md` for coding conventions.
    *   Ensure all implementation follows the established patterns and uses the documented tech stack.

3.  **Plan the Implementation:** Create a todo list using TodoWrite tool to track:
    *   All tasks from the `tasks.md` file that are not yet completed.
    *   Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
    *   Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and phases.

4.  **Follow Best Practices:**
    *   Examine existing codebase structure and conventions before implementing.
    *   Use existing libraries, patterns, and architectural decisions as documented in `docs/tech_stack/framework_choice.md`.
    *   Maintain code quality with proper TypeScript types, error handling, and testing, following the guidelines in `product-docs/project_guides/coding_standards.md`.
    *   Follow the security and performance requirements from the specifications.

5.  **Implement Systematically:**
    *   Work through tasks phase by phase as outlined in `tasks.md`.
    *   Mark tasks as in_progress when starting, completed when finished.
    *   Run linting, type checking, and tests after each major implementation using the commands specified in `docs/README.md`.
    *   Verify that acceptance criteria from `requirements.md` are met.

6.  **Validate Implementation:**
    *   Test all implemented functionality according to acceptance criteria.
    *   Ensure integration with existing codebase components.
    *   Run the full test suite (`nx test web-app`) and build process (`nx build web-app`) to verify no regressions.
    *   **Document Implementation Reality:** As you complete each task, immediately update the `tasks.md` file with what actually worked, what didn't, and any workarounds needed. This creates a valuable reference for future implementations and debugging.

7.  **Completion Checklist:**
    *   [ ] All pending tasks from `tasks.md` are implemented.
    *   [ ] Code follows project conventions and quality standards.
    *   [ ] Tests pass and coverage meets requirements.
    *   [ ] Build processes complete successfully.
    *   [ ] Documentation is updated if needed.

8.  **Final Documentation Updates:**
    *   **Update Task Status with Actual Implementation:** For each completed task in `.kiro/specs/{{spec_name}}/tasks.md`, replace the original planned implementation with:
        *   **ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION:** section with exact commands used
        *   **DEVIATIONS:** section documenting what changed from the original plan and why
        *   **ACTUAL OUTCOME:** section with the real results achieved
        *   Document any issues encountered and how they were resolved
        *   Include alternative commands tried and why they didn't work
        *   Note any version conflicts, dependency issues, or configuration challenges
    *   **Update Documentation:** If new patterns or libraries were introduced, update corresponding files in `docs/` folder:
        *   Update `docs/architecture/service_architecture.md` if folder structure or architectural decisions changed.
        *   Update `docs/tech_stack/framework_choice.md` if new libraries or frameworks were added.
        *   Update `docs/guides/` if new development or testing patterns were established.
    *   **Update Steering Documents:** If there are changes in design decisions or new commands introduced, update relevant files in `.kiro/steering/` directory.
    *   **Update Claude Memory:** Update `CLAUDE.md` or other memory files if new project conventions, patterns, or important context should be remembered for future implementations.

**Important Notes:**
- If specifications reference external dependencies, verify they exist in the project before using.
- **CRITICAL:** Update the `tasks.md` file with actual implementation commands and deviations. Replace theoretical plans with real-world solutions that worked. This documentation is invaluable for troubleshooting, reproducing setups, and training future developers.
- Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous or conflicting.
- Focus on implementing exactly what's specified - no more, no less
- When encountering issues, document both the problem AND the solution in tasks.md for future reference
