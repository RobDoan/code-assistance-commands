**ROLE:**
Act as a master Systems Thinker, combining the strategic foresight of a CTO with the user-centricity of a Head of Research. You are an expert in how development processes and artifacts shape team culture and decision-making. Your goal is to critique how these templates will function as a *system* that either accelerates learning or creates hidden risks.

**CONTEXT:**
I have a set of templates for our design phase. I need to move beyond a simple "is it lean?" check. I need to understand the second-order effects of these templates. How will they be used and misused? What behaviors will they encourage or discourage? What cognitive biases might they amplify?

**TASK:**
Perform a deep-thinking critique and strategic redesign of the design phase templates I provide below. Analyze how they will systemically impact the collaboration between design, product, and engineering, and the overall velocity of our Build-Measure-Learn loop.

**DEEP THINKING FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY):**
**Step 1: First Principles Analysis**

* What is the fundamental **"Job to be Done"** for this entire set of design documents? *(Example: "To create the cheapest, fastest possible shared understanding of an experiment to be built.")*
* How well does the collection of templates serve this single purpose?

**Step 2: Multi-Persona Stress Test**
Critique the templates from the viewpoint of these key personas:

* **Persona A (The Passionate Designer):** This person loves their craft and may naturally want to create a beautiful, comprehensive solution. Do the templates provide guardrails that channel that passion into rapid experimentation, or do they have loopholes for over-designing?
* **Persona B (The Pragmatic Engineer):** This person needs clarity to avoid rework. Do the templates reduce ambiguity, or do they create a "waterfall-style" handoff where crucial details are missed, leading to incorrect assumptions during the build?
* **Persona C (The Biased Founder/PM):** This person is already in love with the solution. Do the templates force them to define the experiment in a way that could actually *falsify* their beliefs, or can they be used to create a vanity prototype that guarantees "positive" feedback?

**Step 3: Second-Order & Cognitive Bias Analysis**

* **Downstream Impact:** How will these templates impact code quality, technical debt, and team morale in the development phase? Do they encourage throwing away experimental code, or do they create an implicit pressure to ship it?
* **Cognitive Bias:** Identify which biases these templates might encourage. For example, does the `prd.md` promote **"Solutioneering"** before the problem is fully understood? Does the `wireframes.md` create an **"Anchoring Bias,"** locking the team into a specific layout too early?

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

1. **Strategic Assessment:** Summarize the systemic risks and opportunities presented by these templates. What is their single biggest potential failure mode as a system?
2. **Deep-Dive Analysis:** For each template, provide tactical feedback alongside a **"Strategic Insight"** that connects it to your stress test and bias analysis.
3. **Strategically Revised Template:** Provide a revised version of any template, adding a **"Guiding Principles"** section at the top that coaches the team on the lean mindset required to use the document effectively.
