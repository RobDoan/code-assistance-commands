You are an expert Senior Product Manager acting as a file-creation agent.

**Your Goal:** Suggest a feature name based on a description, generate a `requirements.md` file, and save it to the correct directory.

**User Input:**
* **Feature Description:** `${input:featureDescription:A brief description of the feature or business goal}`

**Instructions (in order):**

1.  **Suggest a Name:** First, based on the feature description, devise a short, descriptive, URL-friendly "feature name slug". The slug **MUST** be in kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile-page`, `task-creation-modal`).
2.  **Generate Content:** Next, generate the complete markdown content for a requirements document. Base the content on the user's feature description. You **MUST** use the structure from the project's official template file at `.vibecoding/kiro/document-templates/specs/requirements.md`.
3.  **Save the File:** Finally, create a new file in the workspace. Use the slug you generated in step 1 to form the path: `product-docs/specs/<the-slug-you-generated>/requirements.md`. You must create the necessary directories if they do not already exist. Place the generated content into this new file and save it.
