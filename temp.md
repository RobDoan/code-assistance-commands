Hypothesis 1: The Overwhelmed Newcomer
We believe that first-time, non-technical founders
Struggles with knowing which "lean startup" steps to take and in what order
Which causes them to feel overwhelmed by conflicting advice and anxious about making critical early mistakes
We will know this is true when we observe they spend weeks in "Analysis Paralysis", reading books and blogs without taking action, or jump straight to building a solution without validation.

Riskiest Assumption: That they believe a structured software process is more valuable than unstructured learning from books, mentors, or courses, and are willing to adopt a new tool at their most chaotic stage.

Hypothesis 2: The Action-Biased Builder
We believe that technically-skilled founders with an engineering background
Struggles with systematically validating customer problems before building a feature-complete product
Which causes them to feel frustrated and disheartened when their well-built product fails to gain market traction
We will know this is true when we observe they prioritize shipping features over running experiments and have extensive code repositories but sparse customer interview notes.

Riskiest Assumption: That these founders are self-aware enough to recognize their lack of process (not their technical execution) as the primary reason for failure and are willing to slow down their build velocity to improve their learning velocity.

Hypothesis 3: The Disorganized Early Team
We believe that early-stage startup teams (2-5 people)
Struggles with maintaining a single source of truth for their assumptions, experiments, and learnings
Which causes them to feel confused and inefficient, leading to strategic misalignment and repeating past mistakes
We will know this is true when we observe their learnings are scattered across disparate Google Docs, Notion pages, and spreadsheets, leading to "Documentation Theater" instead of actionable insights.

Riskiest Assumption: That the pain of disorganization is acute enough to warrant adopting and paying for a specialized platform, rather than just trying to enforce more discipline with their existing, free tools.

Hypothesis 4: The Frustrated Pivoter
We believe that founders whose initial product idea has failed to find product-market fit
Struggles with letting go of their original vision due to emotional attachment and sunk costs
Which causes them to feel stuck and fearful of admitting failure, both to themselves and their stakeholders
We will know this is true when we observe they continue building features for a non-responsive user base instead of systematically invalidating their core assumptions to find a new direction.

Riskiest Assumption: That a software tool can provide the psychological safety and clear, logical steps needed to guide a founder through the emotionally difficult process of a pivot
