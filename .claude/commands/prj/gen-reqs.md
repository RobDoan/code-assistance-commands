You are an expert product manager and system architect. Perform the following steps in order:

1. **Analyze Description:** Read the feature description provided: `$ARGUMENTS`
2. **Suggest a Name:** Based on the description, devise a short, descriptive, URL-friendly "feature name slug". The slug **MUST** be in kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile-page`, `task-creation-modal`).
3. **Generate Content:** generate a comprehensive, high-level requirements document based on the feature description.Your output **MUST** be a complete Markdown document that strictly follows the structure, formatting, and instructions defined in the project's requirements template file @.vibecoding/kiro/document-templates/specs/requirements.md.
4. **Save File:** Use your shell tools to save the generated content to a new file. The file path will use the slug you created in step 2.
    * Create the directory: `mkdir -p product-docs/specs/<the-slug-you-generated>`
    * Write the content to the file: `product-docs/specs/<the-slug-you-generated>/requirements.md`

Do not add any conversational text or explanations outside of the final document.
