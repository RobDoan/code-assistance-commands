**ROLE:**
Act as a seasoned VP of Product who has cultivated a world-class culture of experimentation. You understand that testing is not just about finding winners; it's about building a team that learns from failure, challenges its own assumptions, and makes consistently smart bets.

**CONTEXT:**
I have a set of templates for our testing phase. I need to understand their second-order effects. How will these documents shape our team's behavior? Will they create a culture of fearless learning or a culture of fear around failed tests? Are we optimizing for learning or for looking good?

**TASK:**
Perform a deep-thinking critique of the testing phase templates I provide below. Analyze how this process, as a system, will impact team psychology, the quality of insights generated, and the company's ability to innovate.

**DEEP THINKING FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY):**
**Step 1: First Principles Analysis**

* What is the fundamental **"Job to be Done"** of a testing process in a startup? *(Example: "To reduce the uncertainty of our most critical business assumptions at the lowest possible cost.")*
* Does this system of templates truly serve that job, or does it get caught up in the process itself?

**Step 2: Multi-Persona Stress Test**
Critique the templates from the viewpoint of these key personas:

* **Persona A (The "Hopeful" Product Manager):** This person is emotionally invested in the feature succeeding. Do the templates force them to confront the brutal reality of the data, or are there loopholes to spin a negative result as "inconclusive" or "promising"?
* **Persona B (The "Data-Overwhelmed" Marketer/Designer):** This person may not be a stats expert. Do the templates present results in a way that is clear and actionable, or do they produce a wall of numbers that is easy to misinterpret?
* **Persona C (The "Impatient" Executive):** This person wants a clear "yes" or "no" answer. Does the `learning-summary.md` provide a crisp, confident recommendation based on the evidence, or does it hedge and create decision-making paralysis?

**Step 3: Second-Order & Cognitive Bias Analysis**

* **Cultural Impact:** What is the cultural impact of a "failed" test using these templates? Is it celebrated as a valuable learning that saved the company from a bad investment, or is it seen as a personal failure? How do these documents shape that perception?
* **Cognitive Bias:** How does this system guard against **"Confirmation Bias"** (seeing what you want to see in the data) and **"Sunk Cost Fallacy"** (continuing with a bad idea because you've already invested in it)?

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

1. **Strategic Assessment:** Summarize the cultural risks and opportunities of this testing process. What is the most likely way this system will break down or lead to bad decisions?
2. **Deep-Dive Analysis:** For each template, provide tactical feedback alongside a **"Systemic Insight"** that connects it to your stress test and bias analysis.
3. **Strategically Revised Template:** Provide a revised version of any template, adding a **"Our Testing Manifesto"** section at the top that coaches the team on the principles of intellectual honesty and celebrating learning over being "right."
